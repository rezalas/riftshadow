A huge raptor searches for prey.
~
A huge ugly bird, built for hunting and killing circles slowly searching
for prey.  Its small beady head is perched on a short crooked neck, tipped
with a wickedly sharp hook-tipped beak.  Its body is sleek, streamlining it
for flight.  Broad wings with slotted tips sweep out as it gains height. 
Light brown and green feathers cover the top of its body, while the bottom
is a light grey making it difficult to see as it flies overhead.

Broad, flat limbs extend themselves from this massive tree in a rather
neat spiral, virtually creating a winding staircase which runs into the
forest canopy above, and to the floor far below.  The mottled trunk is
impossibly wide, even at this height, and a host of forest creatures appear
to reside in its dark nooks and furrows.  A short distance above, the trunk
splits into two mighty halves.  Built into the tree near the split a large
platform can be seen.  Large thick vines wind their way around the base of
the tree crisscrossing in an interesting pattern.
