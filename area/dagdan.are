A stray cat meanders here.
~
This feline appears to be on the very brink of starvation.  Its fur is
matted and coated with dust to the point that its original color can
no longer be discerned.  Though the life it leads would seem to be
disagreeable, you don't find yourself feeling sorrow for it... as it
bares its teeth and hisses directly at you.

This dog seems to be looking for a cat to eat.

Almost wiry enough for a wolf, this dog prowls the streets of Dagdan
snapping at everything he passes.  His fur is gray streaked with black
and even has a few white spots.  He's obviously a mutt, and has likely
lived the life of a wild animal.  Don't waste your time trying to

permanently by herbs, and perhaps, by the passage of much arcane power
through their mortal tissue.  She has obviously not focused her training on
combat, as you see no weapons or trophies of any kind on her person, and yet
you feel you can safely assume she would be able to defend herself rather
adequately.

used his unassuming appearance and charming personality to get close
to quite a few of his targets.  You can only discern his occupation
by his proximity to so many others who are less secretive about their
place in life.  Apparently this man isn't interested in stealth while

A celestial titan woman plods heavily across the cobblestones of Dagdan,
tired from a long journey.  She began near the Crimson Sea, and now travels
to the oceans beyond the forest to the north to visit others of her kind. 
Perhaps because she is female, she is smaller than most celestial titans,
and can ride a mount.  A HUGE mount.  Her clothing appears to have been
woven from kelp, and she has dozens of water skins, insulated canteens, and
jugs full of her favorite liquid about her person... on a necklace, attached
to her belt, and filling her pack.  This woman loves water.

The mayor of Dagdan stands here smiling and greeting those who pass.

Baram Evir, the mayor of Dagdan, shakes your hand as you pass.  He is
richly clothed, as you might expect.  The crest of Dagdan (though it
seems rather presumptuous for such a poor frontier town to have a
crest, let alone a mayor) is emblazoned upon his bright tunic.
Suddenly, he speaks in a deep and thickly accented voice:

"As with any frontier settlement, we've experienced our share of
outlaw activity," he explains in a well-rehearsed speech.  "However,
as mayor, I've taken certain steps to assure that nothing like that
will rear its ugly head here again.  While in the town, you'll
doubtless see the criminal element being escorted beyond our city
limits."  Baram winks, points to a grumbling thief nearby, and moves
on to deliver the same speech to the next traveler coming into Dagdan.

himself, where a canvas collar seems to be disrupting the finely-preened

beats remind you of war, then of the sound of a horse galloping across an
open plain, and then of the monotony of sea travel.  There seems to be no
end to this man's rhythmic vocabulary.

sea captain sailor man seafaring~
a sea captain~
A seafaring man is here, drowning his sorrow.
~
This man's tale of woe begins with a single beer, and ends with a very
large drink.  "THE drink," in fact--the ocean.  It seems he had a bit too
much grog in Cimar the morning his ship was to depart for the rather
mysterious southern continent by way of the Crimson Sea, and he navigated
her directly onto the rocks surrounding the island there.  His beached ship
was abandoned, and shortly picked apart by scavenging pirates.  The only
bright point he can make is that his cargo was already in Cimar--and he was
returning to the other continent for another load.  Stone, for building,
carved directly out of the Ruby Mountains.  If he had been carrying such a
load at the time of his accident, his boat would have drawn a much deeper
trail through the sea, and would have beached much farther out on the water.
His men would have drowned trying to reach shore, or worse, been killed by
raiding pirates.  Between hiccups and burps, the captain relates this tale
of what he considers to be "an unlucky sort of luck," and then fades into a
comatose state on the bar.

you need to talk.  He purchased this inn with money he earned on his
own, and he keeps it up with the constant business Dagdan's location
provides.  His vest is smudged with various food products and stained
with every variety of drink, and his black hair is a tangled mess atop
his square head.  If he were any less friendly, you could picture him
as a fearsome street fighter rather easily.

pride, and then shows you his favorite items--the foliage from the Vale of

rich mountain soil.  Danellanor has found uses for uniquely elven plants
which no other botanist has yet conceived.

Pzandra, the duergar blacksmith, is here.
~
Her beard would put Morglum himself to shame.  Her hairy chin waggles as
Pzandra gossips with other women in this shop, and her thick, oily black
beard juts directly out like a pike, waggling up and down with it.  Pzandra
seems remarkably friendly for a duergar... until one of the Dagdan gossips
mentions her neighbor Tarni.  Her eyes turn to pure iron, and she stiffens
suddenly.  A few acidic barbs are spat, and she turns coldly to her forge to
continue with the work she's been avoiding.  The other women scatter from
the shop, fleeing in terror from this duergar woman's temper.

Tarni~
Tarni, the dwarven mithril smith, is here.
~
Tarni is hard at work on a large, flat piece of mithril.  What it is
destined to become isn't apparent yet, but the red hot slab of metal
is quickly taking shape and form, and with that, function and purpose.
She looks up and sees you entering, greets you warmly, and warns you
to avoid the puddle at the door (just in time).  As you gaze
around her shop, you hear someone screaming next door.  You turn your
face toward Tarni, with an expression of confusion, and she sighs
apologetically.  "Pzandra, an intensely emotional duergar," she
laughs.  "We have a healthy business relationship."  Tarni scratches
her beard, sniffs and shrugs, then goes back to work.

E war belt~
An interesting article of clothing indeed, this belt is thick and
wide, protecting quite a bit of a warrior's midsection.  It is tapered
in front and back to allow better range of movement, but bolstered on
each side to prevent wrenching the lower part of the spine in odd
directions.  It has half a dozen pockets and pouches trailing around
its outer face, and each of these holds something which is used to
inflict pain in a brawl.  Brass knuckles, iron spikes, a small sack
filled with a few lumps of lead...  On the inner face of this belt,
a long series of strange symbols is etched.

On the Road~
A smaller, narrower road than the one to the east, this is little more
than a path between two villages: Koteras and Dagdan.  To the south, Koteras
beckons with its proximity to Cimar.  Northwest of here, Dagdan promises an
exciting and untamed wilderness beyond the forests and mountains mapped thus
far.  Directly to the east, a dusty saloon filled with unsavory characters
blocks your view of the other road.

The Road to Dagdan~
This is a wide dirt path made from moist, healthy soil.  It leads from
west to east, and is wide enough for ten men to walk abreast.  To the south,
the plains reach as far as the eye can see with no break save for the road
to Koteras off to the east.  To the north, the dazzling forest you've been
gawking at is clear through the mist which seems to envelop it.  The sound
of strange birdcalls is audible, and you've not heard their like anywhere
else in the world... To the northwest, you can make out a cluster of
buildings along the edge of the huge forest.

A Turn~
Here, the road to Dagdan bends from north to east and from east to north.
This area is covered with cobblestones, and as you look to the north, they
continue on toward a cluster of buildings to that direction -- presumably
Dagdan itself.  The street ends here, and to the south and west stretch
endless plains.  Off in the east, you see the road to Koteras, and beyond
the city to the north is a vast forest, nearly covering the horizon in that
direction.  There's a very strange warbling sound in the air all around
you...

The Gate to the Great Northwest~
On the very outskirts of Dagdan, you encounter a huge sign painted
in mostly gold and silver which reads:

"Welcome to Dagdan, the Gate to the Great Northwest."

Just down the street to the north, the tiny town of Dagdan sits,
nearly devoured by the Giant Forest beyond it.  The town is close
enough that you can make out every detail, and yet it is this forest
which dominates your field of view.  It towers above the town and
looms like a titanic predatory animal ready to descend and crush the
infinite plains to your south.  You are still well beyond its reach,
and yet it seems to curve through the air above you and soar so far
into the air directly above you, that you stumble backwards glimpsing
the tops of these impossibly tall trees.

Dagdan's South Gate~
This collection of shops and streets forms a quaint little town, and
its setting is one of the most dramatic in Shalar -- right on the brink
of the Giant Forest.  Those trees stand like sentinels over this tiny
settlement, and the trade done here all takes place within their
shadow.  If a traveler has just arrived, he's either come from the
forest to the north or the plains to the south, and in need of
significant rest.  If he's leaving, he's on his way to one of those,
and this tradepost of a city exists to provide him with supplies for
the long journey ahead.

purpose.  As you glance upward, you are reminded of the Giant Forest,

The Mayor's Home~
This is Baram Evir's private dwelling, inhabited usually only during

seeing to the enforcement of his anti-outlaw plan.  Nearly everything
in this room is of the highest quality, constructed of the most
expensive materials imaginable.  Trade, and the constant flow of
business in travelers coming through, has obviously been good to
Dagdan and it's mayor.  The room consists of a desk in the center
with a large chair behind it.  Several bookshelves line each wall,
and a small bed is in the northwest corner next to a fireplace.

Tree Road~
While unimaginatively named by the inhabitants of Dagdan, this road
seems to be a well-kept one.  People wander the streets happily,
purchasing goods and looking for a place to rest.  A few animals are
even seen dashing about from place to place, as though they had
purpose.  As you glance upward, you are reminded of the Giant Forest,
and naming a piece of a town with something so mind-numbingly simple
as "Tree Road" seems as though it would be fairly easy to do.  You
stand in the northwest corner of a small marketplace, and the sound
of metal striking metal grates upon your ears, flying from the north.

Tarni's Smithy~
This humble shop houses some of the most beautifully rendered mithril
armor in Shalar.  Its owner must be amazingly skilled in the art of
mithril smithing.  Lined against one wall are stacks and piles of
breastplates, shining in the sun which filters through the shop's
straw roof.  Against the opposite wall, helmets and gauntlets,
leggings and sleeves are all lovingly mounted and displayed.  As you
step through the center of the shop, you see a desk of sorts
separating the front of the shop from the back, and an open door
behind it leading into the work room.

The Back Room~
This room is much, much warmer than the front of Tarni's shop.  The
main reason for that is likely the forge which burns merrily in a
corner.  Huge blocks of mithril litter the floor here, varying in size
and shape, and in eventual purpose.  Tools of all sorts for
manipulating the glowing heated mithril the forge produces daily are
hanging on the wall.  To the south, a door leads back into the main
shop.

of silent warfare.  In fact, the entire room seems to be bristling

whispering their quiet way across the floor like ghosts pay no
attention to the blades, simply gracefully slipping from place to

many shops and markets.  Hanging from the ceiling, you see a large
wagon wheel studded with magical orbs of continually glowing light,
illuminating the room at all times of the day.  It appears that this
wheel can be turned, obscuring as many of the orbs as seems necessary
behind a wooden panel in order to dim the room's lighting.  A
fireplace crackles merrily at one end of the room, and paintings line

and paintings are unfamiliar to you.  Some of them include depictions
of a large battle in what appears to be New Thalos, a small greyish
man, and a large face divided down its center.

Made of grey and red stones mortared together with a black material,
this fireplace provides tremendous heat to the room.  Along the wall,
you see a system of long, perfectly constructed mithril piping (likely
provided by the town's mithril smith).  This fireplace must generate

A bar larger than any you've seen graces the northwest area of this room,
obviously the centerpiece of this entire floor.  Fully thirty feet long, its
expansive surface seats as many as fifteen men or six titans.  Behind,
Norman stalks back and forth grinning evilly and swapping evil jokes, and a
cabinet -- also thirty feet long -- holds the most amazing amount of liquor
you've ever seen collected.  Loud men drink and shout, and women scurry back
and forth to serve those patrons who have seated themselves in the common
room.  Judging by the food they carry, there must be a grill behind the bar
as well, but it is entirely obscured by either the drunkards, the immense
liquor cabinet, or Norman himself.

seemingly more for decoration than any structural purpose, add to the

this room is a large jumble of the makings of an inn and could likely
furnish an entire separate inn, should Norman someday be inclined to
expand his operation.  There are no windows in this room, and the red
wooden walls smell like the Giant Forest.  Shalar's largest beer keg

A tiny clearing between a few trees north of a trail, this dark area

A Grassy Trail~
Outside the city, this grassy trail leads through the serene outskirts
of Dagdan between Norman's Inn and the road outside town.  South
and east of here, the expansive plains of the northwest stretch on to
the horizon.  No fence stands between you and the plains to the south
and east -- simply the buildings of Dagdan and a few trees on one
side, endless plains on the other.  Staring out at the plains, it's
easy to feel very small and lost...

Pzandra's Smithy~
Dank and dreary, poor lighting dooms this shop to little business.
A few works of iron are scattered around the floor, and the small
forge in the corner sits cold and unused like a sleeping mammoth.
Examining the iron strewn about the shop, you realize what an ugly
metal it is... dusty and dull, poorly shaped and constructed,
Pzandra's items aren't worth real money.  The noise in this shop is
loud and obnoxious, but it isn't what you might expect -- the sound
of metal striking metal is mysteriously absent.  Instead, shrill
voices chatter and gossip late into the night every day...

The Butcher Shop~
This establishment is not kept clean.  That much is evident as you
nearly slip and fall in a pool of animal blood near the door.  This
town's butcher is apparently an over-enthusiastic fellow... the walls
are spattered with blood, and in some places, even the ceiling is
spotted with the dried, dark red substance.  Despite the horrible
conditions, the cuts of meat seem well carved, and have been wrapped
to prevent flies from getting to them.  Enthusiasm is to be lauded,
at least...

The Little Vale~
Plants and pots, dirt and water... these are the themes of this small
and simplistic shop.  Simple, yet perhaps the most wonderful in
Dagdan.  You see plants of types that are as common as grass, and more
which have no name in your mind.  There are scents you've never
imagined breezing about, riding through the store on a forest wind
from the north.  Leaves and vines flutter in this breeze, and flower
petals ride through the air along with the damp air.  This shop truly
does remind you of a miniature version of the beautiful Vale of
Arendyl.

The End of the Road~
Staring toward the forest from here, you receive a sensation of
hurtling from the civilized world directly into the jaws of nature...
The trees may appear giant from the town to the south, but from this
vantage point, their monolithic size is disquieting.  All around you,
tree trunks the size of houses fire angrily upward from the soil at a
dizzying rate to slash the very surface of the celestial hemisphere
above.  If you keep your eyes to the ground, perhaps you will avoid
the overwhelming feeling of disorientation that comes with this
forest.  North, you can easily make out a clearing between several
massive trunks.  To the south, the tiny town of Dagdan breaks its
way free of the Giant Forest's clutches.

A Tiny Clearing~
A bed of grass and the fine mulch of rotted leaves makes for very
comfortable footing here.  Any intake of breath nearly overwhelms you,
the amazingly sweet scent of the wood of this forest is pungent enough
to pierce any haze you may be experiencing mentally, and then create a
whole new one for you.  The light which filters down this far through
the tree cover above you is a deep green color, casting an eerie glow
upon all of your surroundings.  To the north, the Giant Forest dives
down the steep sides of a huge valley that's impossible to see from
outside the woods south of here...  You can actually peer between the
massive trunks to the immediate north, and above the treetops far off
in the distance.  The view from here, provided that you can find a
line of sight through the trees, is amazing.  A vast mountain range
strikes its way through the clouds in the northeast, and to the
northwest, this forest continues beyond the opposite edge of the deep
valley which neutralizes its towering height, and on to the horizon.

The edge of a monstrous valley, this part of the forest is on a fairly
steep incline.  The trail you are on leads north into the valley and
south out of it.  The leaf cover far above you almost entirely snuffs
out any light which might attempt to pierce it.  The forest around you
is not dark by any means, but its lighting is twilight-like at best,
perpetually.  An odd warbling sound fills the forest -- the call of
the wild turkey, an odd looking species of bird which is one of many
that are unique to this part of the continent.  To your north, the
valley continues toward what appears to be the edge of the world (but
what is likely simply the other side of this titanic valley).  South,
you can climb up to the edge of this side.

exudes, and make it feel more like an uncivilized frontier town.
This is likely one place where the Mayor plans to expand and continue

sheets for protection and anonymity.  You can move north and west from
here, and a large pile of crates makes almost perfect stairs...

In the Rafters~
The reason you climbed up here is a fact you've forgotten, and in its
place is a great deal of concern for your well-being.  The upper level
of this warehouse is extremely hot -- the prairie sun beats down on it
all day long, and the heat inside the rest of the warehouse all rises
to here.  Beyond the uncomfortable warmth, the only way to move around
is by edging along the rafters in any given direction.  The fact that
it's very dark up here doesn't help matters in that respect any,
either.  The sweet scent of the wood everything in Dagdan is
constructed with is baked by the sweltering heat, and its intensity is
nearly sickening up here.

Through the Hole~
It's quite a lot cooler on this side of the wall than inside the
warehouse.  In fact, this small tunnel-like structure doesn't even
appear to be indoors... rather, roughly built upon the roof of a
building next to the warehouse, as though it were an afterthought
and not a part of the original design.  To the south, a few faint
whispers can be heard in the cool darkness.  To the west, you can
crawl through a hole and into the rafters of the warehouse next door.

Entrance to the Thieves' Guild~
This part of the impromptu tunnel widens somewhat, and a few quiet men
have gathered here to whisper.  Grey cloth is draped across the wooden
framework of the tunnel, in order to make it "lightproof."  The system
seems to work, as this area is pitch black.  To the south, a tiny
light source flickers gently off the walls, while to the north, utter
blackness consumes the tunnel once again.  The air is cool, and flows
gently back and forth as though it were just another whisperer in the
dark.

The Hidden Room~
A tiny candle flickers from the center of a small table here,
illuminating what appears to be a friendly card game.  The men in this
room are all experienced thieves, and the card players intently watch
each other's hands to insure that no unauthorized thievery breaks out.

It is here that some of the finest thieves in this region of Shalar are
trained.  A few dummies with pockets of varying size have been stuffed
into a corner to collect dust -- this guild's master believes in
practice in the field.

Behind the Wall~
This appears to be a very tight hallway which was actually built into
the structure, simply by placing a second wall at this edge of the
building.  West, the boards have been carelessly placed and allow
passage into a warehouse, while the hallway itself moves south.  The
floor here is littered with papers and bottles, as though it receives
quite a bit of traffic and no sanitary visitations.

A Private Room~
Norman has spared no expense in furnishing these private rooms for
paying customers.  An evening's respite, a good night's sleep, and a
place to reflect upon the long journey behind you (or ahead of you)
are all provided perfectly by this comfortable room.  Glass statuettes
and pewter figurines decorate shelves along the walls, and the entire
place is the same orangish-reddish hue as the rest of the inn, made of
that same red wood from the Giant Forest.  Here, though, the wood has
been aged somewhat, and the sometimes sickeningly sweet smell is
slightly less intrusive.  A bed and a cabinet furnish one side of the
room (both made of red wood), and a small linen closet stands open at
the other side, ready for your belongings should you wish to stay and
sleep.
