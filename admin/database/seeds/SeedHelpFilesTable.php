wise leaders, intrigue, war and even its fall and reincarnation, the
organization has stood up to the test of time better than most others of
mortal design in the whole of Shalaran history.

These famed mages have taken residence within the Glass Tower, the 
mysterious mecca of magic that the city of Melcene was built around. 
Accepting only the purest of mages and most dedicated of scholars, the
zealous Scions wage a constant war against ignorance in all forms.  The
belief that ignorance is dangerous, infectious and must be eliminated at
any cost so that mortals as a whole may move forward is held dearly by 
these intellectual elite.

To join this exclusive organization, one must be eager to learn, able to
work and communicate with others in an orderly manner and at least of the
thirteenth rank of his or her guild.

The patron deity of the Scions of Knowledge is Erifdel.

We would like to thank you all for volunteering your time to help test
our forthcoming MUD, and we hope that you\'ll have fun in the process.
At this point, the project is nearing the stage when we will open our
doors to the public at large.  Before this can happen, there are bugs
that need to be worked out, changes and additions finalized, and
things in general polished and tweaked for balance and player
enjoyment.  That\'s where you come in.

You can freely create characters during this Beta, using the password
you were given.  Feel free to experiment with different combinations,
and try things out.  If you participated in the first beta, you\'ll recall that
levels and skills and the like were handed out for free most of the time.
That was useful at that point, to rapidly expose bugs and flaws in our
system, but that approach fails to yield a meaningful perspectice on
what a player\'s experience will realistically be.  Thus, expect minimal
direct immortal intervention in the form of advancement, restores,
transfers, equipment, and the like.

What\'s new:
Five classes, all races, two cabals. Areas are largely complete, though
many are missing some descriptions (or many in the case of our roads)
and quests, which will be added over the course of the beta.  We felt
it more important to allow people to start testing, than to hold off to have
areas 100% complete.

What you should do:

** Use the BUG command to report any bugs you find.  Particularly
complicated bugs should be handled via a note to Immortal.  If
something seems grossly out of line, feel free to PRAY about it and 
an immortal will come take a look immediately.

** Use the TYPO command to report any typos you come across.
If it\'s in a room description or on a mob, please use the command in
the same room as the typo occurs, for our convenience.

** Explore the mud.  Kill mobs.  Rank.  Kill each other.  Try out the
skills.   Above all, have fun.  This is technically volunteer work, but let\'s
be serious--it\'s a game.  If you think aspects of the game are not
enjoyable, let us know!  Have any cool ideas for things you\'d like to see?
Let us know!  We\'re very open-minded and responsive to all forms of
suggestions.

That said... welcome to Riftshadow!

and responsibilities.  This means that we trust you with something that
literally tens of thousands of hours of work has gone into.  We expect you
to do all of our work justice and follow the rules that we\'ve set forth to
keep this game fair and fun for all.

1) Our biggest and most strictly enforced rule for all Immortals is: do not
   aid or favor your mortals, or the mortals of anyone else you know in any
   way shape or form.  This includes but is not limited to restoring,
   loading equipment or mobs, empowering without roleplay (which is 
   impossible for you to do with yourself), giving experience and
   transferring.  If you have any questions about this particular rule, you
   are encouraged to ask, and not experiment or test the limits.  Violation
   of this rule WILL get you denied.

   Do not log on as your mortal while your Immortal is logged on.  There 
   will be VERY few exceptions to this rule.  Giving the impression to our 
   players that there is cheating going on is just as bad as actually 
   cheating.  Play on a different MUD if you have to.

2) If you don\'t have a certain Wiz command, it\'s for a reason.  As you
   probably already know, there are ways to manipulate OLC to load objects,
   mobs and the like and even give easy experience to players.  Doing this
   will get you denied, as it is a violation of the trust we\'ve given you.
   If you need something loaded, or need to give a player experience, etc.,
   for a reason you believe to be valid, ask a higher-level Immortal.  If
   a higher-level Immortal is not around, you are expected to wait and not
   take the matter into your own hands.  This includes forcing mobs to drop 
   things, killing or slaying them or the like.

3) Do not hold OOC discussions with a player, especially in front of other
   players, unless it\'s in the Realm of the Dead or Description Room... or
   of course the Newbie Channel.

4) Finally... one of the most unprofessional things is the appearance of 
   disorder. If we don\'t appear to be on the same page as an Immstaff, then 
  
   we look badly as a result.  If people get three different answers from 
   three different Imms to the same question, or if one of us tells a 
   mortal "Well, yeah, that\'s how it is, but I don\'t like it either." 
   that\'s not acceptable.  Please don\'t try to speak for Riftshadow or the 
   Immstaff as a whole without checking with other (preferably higher) Imms
   first.  If you think a player is right and we (i.e. other Imms, or the 
   status quo) are wrong, thank them and tell them you\'ll look into it.  
   Then tell the rest of us and we\'ll decide what to do.  Don\'t tell the 
   players that you agree with them and certainly don\'t promise something 
   will get changed if you don\'t know it will. 

If you have any questions, ask a higher-level Imm, and use common sense.
If there\'s any question in your mind about something, just don\'t do it
until you\'ve spoken with others.',

the nature of the beings on the face of Shalar; to abuse whatever they 
can whenever they can is similarly the goal of those who follow the 
platinum pickaxe.  Those of the Duzkatae clan are born with the strength 
and power to do what others are incapable of.  They are the hunters, and 
anyone weaker is the hunted... it is a natural process for the strongest 
of the land to eliminate the weak, so they do not infest the populace with 
their defective ideals and bloodline.  The Duzkatae do as they wish when 
they wish, and anyone who seeks the mark of the platinum pickaxe will 
never give that power up, while actively seeking to end the lives of those
they consider to be aberrations.

forge entire documents, paintings, weapons, and an assortment of potions
and scrolls that could fool anyone at a first glance. While these replicas
will not last indefinitely, or hold up under intense scrutiny, by the time

upon two factors: the intelligence of the student, and the extent to which he

This anti-paladin spell opens a line of communication with the Abyss.  
Once in effect, the name of a demon must be spoken.  It must be cast in 
the right conditions; demons prefer to conduct their business under the 
cover of darkness, and in complete privacy.  Many demons will become angry 
or not respond at all if another mortal is even within shouting distance.

Though life may seem complex at first, you can and will become used to it.
Using this guide, along with the knowledge provided to you at the Shalaran
Academy, you will be well on your way to becoming a successful adventurer.

Now, to get started...
As you already know, you are of a certain race and a certain class. Each
race and class has its own advantages, disadvantages and helpfiles. It is
highly recommended that you view the helpfiles on all races and classes,
as to get a better taste of yourself and your environment. As a matter of
fact, there is a helpfile for just about everything. Feel free to read
as many as you can! All prepared adventurers carry equipment with them. 
The equipment that you wear can be viewed using the \'EQUIPMENT\' command, 
while the items in your inventory can be viewed with the \'INVENTORY\' 
command. While you are still below your 10th rank, you will be able to use
the OUTFIT and RECALL commands, which equip you with some basic equipment 
and transport you to the temple of your hometown, respectively. To view 
the skills and spells that are available to your class, use the \'SKILLS\' 
and \'SPELLS\' commands, respectively. For classes that require empowerment, 
you will need to use the \'SUPPLICATIONS\' command. As a reminder, there is 
a helpfile for every skill, spell and supplication that you might see on 
your lists, so be sure to check into them. This is a playerkilling MUD, 
but those below the 11th level are protected, and may not initiate nor be 
the target of player-versus-player attacks. Another way to gain information 
on how to function and interact is the newbie channel. Under the level of 
twenty five you can use the newbie channel to ask out of character questions 
of other people who have the channel toggled on. The command for using the 
channel is \'NEWBIE\' followed by the message or question that you wish to 
ask.

always on the lookout for potential new imms who want to put the time and 
effort into making RS a better MUD.  People interested in becoming imms 
should write a note to immortal after achieving level 51 to let us know, 
and we will review your application.

There are several criteria upon which your application will be judged:

1) Roleplay:  This is the most important one.  RS Immortals have to be 
capable of maintaining a high standard of roleplay for the entire MUD.  
You should probably have a role (using the role command), and characters 
whose excellent roleplay has been noticed have a much better chance of 
succeeding.  If you\'re constantly telling your group that there\'s 1k TNL 
and you\'re logging off to go watch wrestling (yes, we\'ll know), you 
probably shouldn\'t bother.

2) Time:  Being an immortal is a time consuming task.  While we understand 
that people can be busy for short periods of time, an active immstaff is 
necessary for the betterment of the MUD.  If you play once a week for 
fifteen minutes, the odds of you imming are very slim.  If you become an 
entry level imm, you will be expected to spend at least five hours a week 
on the MUD.

3) History:  Obviously, all RS Immortals are required to obey all rules, 
both immortal and mortal.  As a consequence, any new immortals should have 
no history of cheating, permagrouping, or anything else sketchy.  We 
understand that people make mistakes and we\'re willing to give people a 
chance, but if the current character has had rules violations, you 
probably shouldn\'t bother.


We encourage people to apply even if they\'re not sure they\'ll be accepted, 
providing that they are ready to do the work required if they are 
accepted.  At the worst, you won\'t receive a response.',

entertaining to those who play them.  In order to be fun for everyone, a
game must be fair and equal to all who play.  It is for this reason that
we have established a set of rules for all who wish to take part in the 
fun; we want everyone to have a good time.

Our most important rule: Always stay in character.
This may sound simple enough, but it embodies most of the other rules that
we have set forth.  Breaking these rules ruins the environment that both 
the Immortal Staff and the Players work so hard to maintain.

 * Playerkilling is allowed and encouraged.  This does not mean, however,
that you may do it without an "in character" (IC) reason.  You must
roleplay ALL interactions with other players (with very few exceptions), 
combat included.  Out of character (OOC) interactions are not allowed 
while within the game.

 * Exploiting bugs is extremely out of character, and of course unfair.
Players found doing this will be dealt with harshly.  Dropping link to 
avoid death is against the rules, and players caught doing so would suffer 
consequences much more severe than those that they would be attempting to 
escape.

 * Multicharring/multiplaying (having more than one character logged on at
a time) is not allowed.  On that note, using one character to defeat a mob,
gather equipment or otherwise help another one of your characters, directly
or indirectly, mechanically or politically, is not allowed or tolerated. 
Grouping with other people that you know OOC is fine, as long as your
interactions are fully roleplayed.  "Permagrouping," as it is called, is
against the rules as well as generally frowned upon.

The rules are not limited to these specific examples of wrongdoing, so we 
ask you to please think before your actions, because if you think it\'s
against the rules, there\'s a good chance that it is. Any questions can be
addressed via e-mail to immortals@riftshadow.net, and we will respond as
quickly as possible. We honestly don\'t want to punish anyone for breaking 
any of these rules. Having to do so is definitely not fun for us, the 
cheater/rulebreaker, or those whose gaming experience is effected by the 
actions of the cheater/rulebreaker.  In short, please follow the rules so 
that we can all have fun!

are shrouded in mystery, however, the reason why they are considered the
greatest thorn in the side of civilized Shalar is not.

Their feats have been the foundation for numerous folktales; entire trading
caravans being destroyed by an axe-wielding lunatic who was half-man and
half-beast, for example.  Even Cimar itself has seen its share of
barbarian raids.  As Shalar becomes more civilized, the raids upon its
supposed safehavens become more and more frequent by this powerful and
frighteningly mysterious force.  

It is said that the men and women of the Horde inhabit a place among dying 
trees that is filled with blood, ale and ancient, indescribable things.

fulfilling contracts...  The union is opened to any who wish a place in

did not interfere in cabal politics, it merely observed and endured.  
Their powers came from the aid they extend to one another, and not from 
any god-imbued item.

The Common Guild only allowed those who are capable of working with others 
unselfishly and loyally. Such is necessary for the common man to gain 
power in the cold and brutal world of Shalar.

In this time of great chaos and political turmoil, it has proven to be
impossible for an organization such as the Common Guild to realize true
success.  For the time being, the organization has been disbanded.

					'helpdata' => 'Playerkilling is a major aspect of the game of Riftshadow.  It is
encouraged through cabal wars, limited items of great power and
roleplaying, and therefore is commonplace in this MUD.  At low levels, you
will be protected from other players, and they from you.  Upon reaching the
11th level, this protection will no longer be granted to you, and you will 
be able to kill other players, and they you.  A level 51 character won\'t be
able to bully around level 11\'s, of course.  We have what is called a "PK
range" system to keep this from happening, which is based upon many factors
to keep things fair, so that those who you can fight with are never more
than a few levels above or below you.

Playerkilling must be roleplayed.  Your character may die, but you should
not allow it to anger you in real life.  Far too often, people bring
in-character conflicts into real life, and begin hurling threats and
insults at the player behind the character.  This is a rules violation and
will not be tolerated.  Killing the same person multiple times or killing 
without a roleplayed reason is also frowned upon, and should it become 
necessary, the Immstaff will intervene.

The main trick to playerkilling in Riftshadow is to keep with it. Instead
of losing hope when you are killed, learn from the mistakes that you have
made and become better.  In order to minimize the frustration of PK deaths
for the defeated without taking away reward for the victor, corpses may
only be looted one object at a time, and full-looting is discouraged. This
gives the defeated player time to get back to his or her corpse, so that
he or she can retrieve a good deal of their lost equipment.

In order to roleplay, your character must have a role.  A role, basically,
is a backstory and personality for your character.  Your character\'s life
does not begin at the moment that you begin playing it.  Rather, the 
character has had an entire childhood/adolescence beforehand.  Things 
that take place during these times strongly influence someone and shape 
their personalities.

The ROLE command should be used to describe your character\'s backstory,
personality and beliefs.  It will be visible only to yourself and the
Immortals, so it is safe, and in fact recommended to describe any sort of
intrigue or deception that your character may be involved in.  It is
recommended that you keep the role somewhat brief.  Detail is appreciated,
but as you could imagine, having to go through a 30 page role to 
understand a single character\'s personality would be tiring.

It is not required that you have a role, but it is very strongly
recommended.  Empowerment, tattooing and cabal inductions will all be much
quicker and easier if you have a role, not to mention roleplaying.

affect your character\'s ability to wear some kinds of equipment or 
vulnerability to certain kinds of spells or supplications.  Roleplay-wise,
you will be expected to act in a certain fashion.

The three basic alignments are GOOD, NEUTRAL and EVIL.
There are many, many different ways to play each of the above.  For
example, one could play a militant good character that zealously destroys
evil in all forms.  There could be a good character that accepts the fact
that there are evil people in the world, but strives to live a full life
for himself and others.  There could an evil character that is deceptive
and treacherous, trying to gain power for himself at the cost of others,
or there could be an evil character that\'s just an outright bully.

Of course, roles aren\'t usually this simple and are definitely not limited
to these cookie-cutterish examples.  One important thing to remember is
that evil characters generally don\'t regard themselves as \'evil.\'  It\'s
likely that they just don\'t adhere to the moral code that\'s generally
accepted, or any moral code at all.  By today\'s standards, for example,
someone who would rule by the characteristics listed within \'The Prince\' by
Machiavelli (such as killing people for the sole reason of making an 
example out of them as to secure a political position) would be considered 
incredibly evil, but if you were to ask the person who did it would 
probably not consider themselves evil.  Neutral characters can be anything
from people trying to find balance between the good and evil to people that
are completely animalistic.

Tower.  This document will explain a few of the basic rules to you.  
Firstly, the operations of a chess board can all be accessed via 
the "chess" command.  Simply type "chess," and a world of chess-related 
options mostly regarding chess will become available to you.

WINNING:
The only requirement for winning is that you must place the opposing king 
into a situation which is impossible to get out of.  "Check" is the state 
in which the king is in danger of being captured, and "Checkmate" is the 
state in which there is nothing that can be done to save the king -- the 
king can be saved simply by being moved, by placing another piece in front 
of the king to guard it, or by taking the piece which has the king in 
Check -- if none of those will work, it\'s Checkmate and the game is over!

CAPTURING:
In order to capture one of your opponent\'s pieces, all you need do is move 
your piece to the same square!  You do, of course, need to move according 
to certain rules, however.

when they capture another piece, they do so diagonally.  Someone may try 
and convince you of something called "en passant" piecetaking, but they\'re 
probably cheating.

      far as their path is uninterrupted.

final rule of movement for now), NO PIECE may move in such a way as to put 
its own King in Check.

is Castling.  Castling is a technique used to place your King into a safer 
spot, and to put your rook in play closer to the center of the board, 
rather than forcing the poor thing to languish in obscurity behind a rank 
of lowly pawns.

In order to Castle:
A) It must be the FIRST MOVE OF THE GAME for both the King and the rook 
   being used.
B) There can be no pieces between the King and the rook.
C) The King must not be in Check, nor may he move across a square during 
   the Castling maneuver which is being attacked by an opposing piece.
D) First, the King moves TWO SQUARES toward the rook (the only time in 
   the game in which the King moves more than one square at a time), and 
   then the rook jumps over and lands on the first square on the King\'s 
   other side.

Next, stalemate.  Stalemate is the state during the game in which neither 
King is able to be captured.  An obvious example is each side with only 
their King remaining -- a difficult state to arrive at, but consider that 
in order to move into position to take the opposing King, you must place 
yourself in Check, which is illegal.  Thus, the game cannot end.  
Stalemate!

Though the meddlings of the immortal were largely a hindrance to Shalar\'s 
advancement into a civilized day, mankind did manage a glorious age of 
prosperity and development far beyond what exists today.  From this period 
of paradoxial discord within tranquility emerged new turmoil, however. 
With the arrival of the otherworldly host, some say the first golden age

than the last, and whose details are rarely repetitive.  The one fact 
which remains unchanged through all accounts is the sheer brutality and

Shalar would cease to be, the immortal warriors did indeed part the sky

tendrils of violently lashing power took an innocent Shalaran\'s life or a

found that they had reached an unfortunate quandary: the destruction of

invading force had been necessitated in order to do any good at all.  And 
while this grievous damage was being wrought in the name of Shalar\'s 
freedom, what was certainly the most malevolent threat of the Great War 
made its appearance.

     Then there rose a veritable horizon of impenetrable shadow,
     crowned with lightning and ice, filling all the sky.

     One can only speculate ... that the god, that shaft of

     was forced to retreat, bundling up his Others with him.
     Sound defeat rings through the air, though our champions

ignorance.  It is my hope - my task - to assure the land a chance of 
survival, for certain prophecies were once made:

     is the death of worlds.

...and while Boethius may have indeed been a madman, the last 1500 years 
have brought nothing but truth from his words.  How can the Great War and 
the Others, and their god Dur, have descended into mythos?  How is it that 
so few have speculated upon whence they came, and whether they will 
return?  Keep in mind, children (which I call you for your habits and 
memory), the weight of the Great War: we are a great land which was laid 
waste in a matter of days or weeks, which is rebuilding slowly and which 
cannot withstand another such invasion.  Should the words of Boethius and 
numerous other prophets come to pass, shall we be forced to hide 
helplessly once more?  The gods have not forgotten; be assured, they 
remember well, for they have existed since that time.  Take heed of their 
actions and their will, for they prepare Shalar for war!

knowledge of the ways of old were lost. As the second age began, the 
inhabitants of Shalar no longer held such love for nature as they once 
did.  Nearly all people and races began to rely upon cities and their 
wares. The city life caused them to grow soft, and many of nature\'s 
lessons have since been forgotten.
  
     It is said that Gawinn first appeared in the early days of the 
Second Age.  Out of good will towards mortals, Gawinn sought to teach them 
to return to the natural, in hopes that they might learn from it, and in 
turn better themselves.  By his will he formed an order called 
the "Erethryn", or "Ironwood" in the common tongue. The members of this 
order are said to be as strong and steadfast as their namesake.  
    
      The Erethryn seek to teach the inhabitants of Shalar to depend less 
upon the cities which only serve as a crutch. They wish all to learn 
once again the all-providing power of nature. Only when one returns to the 
wilds will they be strong and steadfast like the ironwood, whos roots are 
planted deeply, and drink deeply alike.

The proficiency system is a general skill subset available to all 
characters.  Proficiency points are awarded automatically for each hour 
played, representing skills acquired as your character grows older.

For every hour, you receive five points which then can be used towards 
training a proficiency.  To train in a proficiency, you must first 
find a teacher.  Teachers can be found all over Shalar, with some basic 
ones residing in the Common Guild\'s former home.  The proficiencies 
command alone lists what proficiencies you know, unless you are in the 
room with a teacher.  In a room with a teacher, it will tell you what 
proficiencies that teacher offers that are available to 
you.  \'Proficiencies basic\' (or \'prof basic\' for short) lists all of the 
basic proficiencies.  More advanced ones will have to be sought out from 
willing teachers all across Shalar.

To train a proficiency, type prof train <proficiency name> when in the 
room with a teacher for that proficiency.  Teachers interested in 
instructing adventurers will typically give a sign of some sort, such as 
a nod or an invitation.
