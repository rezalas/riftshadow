wheels, and pullies command your attention at every glance.  A beautiful
silver chair embossed with stars sits facing the telescope.  
~7~1581065~*4775~A Hallway through Gwenidill~The walls here are made of some form of smooth metal.  A strange glow
seems to eminate from the walls themselves, giving light to the halls.  The
air is heavy with age, and the absolute silence of these halls is
devastating.  An inch of dust covers the floor , and the eyes of a thousand
years seems to bear down on you.  
~7~1581065~*4776~Before a Door Depicting a Large Constellation~Two large doors of guilded gold dominate the eastern wall.  A large
constellation in the shape of a lion is embossed upon the doors face.  A
crystal chandelier hangs down from the ceiling, and strange candles within
it burn with a golden light.  Two tapestries depicting grand feasts hang
upon the southern and western walls.

~7~1581065~*4783~Behind the Throne~You have stumbled into the secret room behind the massive throne. 
Lifeless stone walls suround you completely.  The only thing that catches
your eye is a carving of a lion upon the back wall.  
~7~524296~*4784~A Hallway through Gwenidill~The walls here are made of some form of smooth metal.  A strange glow
seems to eminate from the walls themselves, giving light to the halls.  The

years seems to bear down on you.  
~7~1581065~*4785~Before a Door Carved with Ancient Runes~A large door covered in the runes of ancient dieties commands attention
at the southern wall.  All along the walls near the doors small prayers are
written to remind others.  The floor here is a black marble mixed with veins
of gold running throughout.  Large golden stands are postioned at either end
of the doorway.  
~7~1581065~*4786~The Pantheon of Gwenidill~Huge ceilings rise above your head.  Massive arches made of stone cross
back and forth across the roof, and large murals cover the spaces between. 
Depictions of gods and thier works have been painted to pay tribute to the

~7~1581065~*4792~The Inner Sanctum of Virinahn~An infinate plane stretches out in all directions.  The ground as far as
the eye can see is sand as white as snow.  The sky is black and formless
with only a single star in the sky above.  A constant breeze blows across
the plane, but without sound, leaving the impression of an infinite void.  
~9~14163973~*4793~Dummy Room~~0~4~*29100~A Forest Road~A small road cuts through the trees heading off in an easterly direction
and not seeming to deviate much from that course.  The road itself seems to
have been made of dark grey stones placed carefully side by side.  The
forest surrounding the road is alive with the noises of nature and wildlife.
The stone road continues to the east and originates to the west.  
~0~0~*29101~A Forest Road~The stone grey path continues eastward through the forest.  A bright
light begins to appear further down the road.  The forest is even more alive
with the sound of life.  The forest is thicker here than it was to the west.
The path continues off towards the light to the east.  The exit is further
back through the woods to the west.  
~0~0~*29102~A Forest Road~The forest around the road begins to thin while moving further east.  The
light coming from the east seems even brighter like the sun itself shines at
ground level from the trees.  Wild sounds are more scarce and rocks seem to
be more frequent.  The road seems to decline in mantinence to the east while
the way out begins to become concealed to the west.  
~0~0~*29103~A Crumbling Road~The grey road that seems to have been so well maintained in the steps to
the west is broken seemingly because of weathering of the wind and sand. 
The sand looks to have origniated from the south where rock walls of a
canyon can be seen.  A small trail leads south into the canyon whlie the
road is still whole to the west.  
~0~0~*29104~Beginning of a Canyon Trail~The ground around the trail starts to get rocky, and the walls of the
canyon start their ascent upwards.  Small rocks clatter from the tops of the
canyon walls.  Little noise is made, and few animals are seen.  The path
leads north back to the road or south further into the desert.  
~0~0~*29105~A Canyon Trail~The trail follows along east of the crater as it moves further south. 
Rocks clutter the ground and the canyon walls almost look more like hills
than cliffs.  Small breaths of wind can be felt while walking through here. 
The scents of the forest drift back from the north while more rock and dirt
can be seen off to the west.  
~0~0~*29106~A Small Cave~The trail leads into a small cave that seems to have been created by
rocks falling from the high canyon walls.  This cave seems to have
sat for years in the same state.  There is no sand or extra rock and
the floor of the cave is suprisingly smooth.  The path out of the
cave is to the east.
~0~0~*29107~A Canyon Trail~The trail winds around a big blockage of fallen rocks that could
only have been caused by a large impact of sorts.  Sand follows the
wind from the trail further south, stinging the eyes of travellers
who pass through here.  The path back to the forest road is off to
the east while the path to the desert is to the south.
~0~0~*29108~A Canyon Trail~Broken rock litters the ground as if a road once passed through here. 
The canyon walls seem to get steeper the further south they are followed. 
Sand drifts in from the south, lining the ground.  The trail leads further
south towards the bright sands of the desert while the trail leads north
back towards the crater.  
~0~0~*29109~A Broken Road~The trail that has lead south so far all of the sudden turns into a road
that seems to have been broken with time.  Sand covers the places that are
not made of stone.  The canyon walls almost block out the light.  The broken
road leads further off the the south as well as the east, while the forest
is back to the north.  
~0~0~*29110~A Broken Road~The road continues south towards the scorching sands of the desert.  Sand
covers the places of the road that are no longer stone.  Light barely shows
through the tops of the canyon walls.  The broken road continues to the
south towards the desert and to the west towards the western canyon wall. 
The crater resides further off to the north.  
~0~0~*29111~A Broken Road~The trail that has lead south so far all of the sudden turns into a road
that seems to have been broken with time.  Sand covers the places that are
not made of stone.  The canyon walls almost block out the light.  The broken
road leads further off the the south as well as the west, while the forest
is back to the northwest.  
~0~0~*29112~A Broken Road~The road continues south towards the scorching sands of the desert.  Sand
covers the places of the road that are no longer stone.  Light barely shows
through the tops of the canyon.  The broken road continues to the south
towards the desert and to the east towards the eastern canyon wall.  The
crater resides further off to the north.  
~0~0~*29113~A Broken Road~The road that has so far continued on south comes to a sudden halt
against the canyon wall.  Sand doesn't seem to cover the area so badly here.
This area of the road is mainly rock and is mostly whole.  The light cannot
penetrate the darkness here.  The road continues back to the north and to
the east.  
~0~0~*29114~A Broken Road~The road seems to end here, moving back to a true canyon.  Sand covers
the places where there is no rock as well as the places where there is. 
Light streams onto the ground here from the path ahead.  To the south lies
the canyon and blowing sands of the desert.  To the north and east are the
ways back to the road.  
~0~0~*29115~A Canyon Trail~The trail that runs inbetween the two sheer canyon walls is covered with
sand and small rocks.  Wind blows through the canyon bringing more sand with
it.  The sun beats down on the sand, and the sand reflects the light back
up, making the whole area very warm.  The last of the road can be seen to
the north while the winds of the desert beckon to the east.  
~0~0~*29116~A Canyon Trail~Small rocks clatter from the canyon walls, falling to the ground and
making small impressions into the sand.  The wind coming from the east is
almost blinding when combined with the bright sunlight.  The sand seems to
have piled up into small dunes along the trail.  The beginning of the trail
can be seen to the west while more sand is off to the east.  
~0~0~*29117~A Canyon Trail~The small dunes seem to rise a fraction in size, getting larger off to
the west.  The wind sweeps past, picking up grains of sand and sometimes
even small rocks, pushing them off to the east.  Shelter seems to be a
problem and pushing forward seems to be the best idea.  The trail leads out
of the canyon to the west and the larger sands can be seen to the east.  
~0~0~*29118~A Canyon Trail~The northern wall of the canyon suddenly stops and blocks off the way
further east.  The sheer walls of the canyon seem to lead off to the south
now.  The wind passing through is more rapid now and the sunlight seems
stronger.  The way back to the trail can barely be seen off to the west
while the bright sands of the desert beckon to the south.  
~0~0~*29119~A Canyon Trail~~0~4~*29120~A Canyon Trail~The canyon walls widen as the trail moves south into the desert.  The
trail is covered completely in sands, the dunes large and hard to climb
over.  The wind and sunlight together is blistering here.  The canyon leads
out to the north while the golden sands of the desert stretch off to the
south.  
~0~0~*29121~A Large Dune~~0~0~*29122~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29123~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29124~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29125~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29126~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29127~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29128~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29129~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29130~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29131~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29132~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29133~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29134~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29135~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29136~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29137~Dummy Room~~0~4~*29138~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29139~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29140~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29141~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29142~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29143~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29144~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29145~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29146~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29147~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29148~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29149~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29150~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29151~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29152~The Fallen Desert~~0~0~*29153~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29154~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29155~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29156~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29157~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29158~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29159~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29160~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29161~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29162~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29163~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29164~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29165~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29166~Overlooking a Crater~~0~0~*29167~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29168~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29169~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29170~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29171~A Dead End~~0~0~*29172~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29173~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29174~Dummy Room~~0~0~*29175~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29176~Standing at a Ladder~~0~0~*29177~A Village Tent~~0~0~*29178~A Village Tent~~0~0~*29179~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29180~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29181~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29182~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29183~A Village Tent~~0~0~*29184~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29185~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29186~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29187~The Elder's Tent~~0~0~*29188~The Elder's Tent~~0~0~*29189~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29190~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29191~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29192~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29193~A Path Through the Village~~0~0~*29194~A Village Tent~~0~0~*29100~A Forest Road~A small road cuts through the trees heading off in an easterly direction

Your insight tells you that
apparantly the Caelumaedani are not satisfied with your current description,
and you have been placed here until your appearance is suitable for an
adventurer.  A number of statues stand in various areas of the room, images
of assorted races that you may wish to look at.  Please excuse the mess.  We
are under construction.  
~1~5252100~*1200~The Chat Room~You are lounging in a quiet cosy parlour, warmed by a gentle magical fire
which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  This is one of the many rooms
where the heroes and gods come to socialize.  It is by far one of the most
comfortable!
~7~327688~*1201~Moses' Hangout~You see here a cozy little room with a fireplace.  You can tell it is Moses'
room by the two stone tablets and a bible on a small ledge near the fireplace.
This room was designed for total relaxation.  You can watch television, listen
to the stereo, even soak in a hot tub.
There is a bell here for the butler.
~7~65544~4~10~10~0~~A blast of lightning arcs from the walls!~*1202~The Center of the Universe~You are at the centre of the universe, everything is filled with bright
light in all colors. You feel time and space no longer exist here.
Exits fill the room in all 42 dimensions, leading everywhere.
~7~66056~*1203~Valhalla~This is the huge Hall of Valhalla, where the Gods rule supreme.  The
cavernous building stretches infinitely in all directions.  Valhalla
continues to the east, and the gods make their homes north and south of
the halls.  The golden gates are to the west.  You know not what lies
upward...
~7~8~*1204~Priscilla's Pleasure Palace ~As you look around you, you see the largest collection of erotic toys
in the world!!!  On a table in the middle of the room lies a book titled :
"All You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex..But Were Afraid to Ask"
There are things here that you never even imagined in your wildest dreams!
~7~33288~*1205~The Eye of the Hurricane~The shrieking winds of a monstrous storm surround you, spinning you around
in an endless web of fury. But then, in the middle of turmoil, you find a
strange calm. You find yourself hovering in the calm eye of a hurricane. All
around you you can see the desruction caused by the powerful storm. White
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this
storm is going to be here a while.
~9~25100~*1206~Walking on the Moon~The proud and lonely silence of Mare Imbrium surrounds you, as you gaze upon
the sterile splendor of the moon.  All around is the velvet curtain of night,
studded with a thousand gleaming jewels.  Below you hangs the beautiful
fields of Earth, looking fragile and far away, but full of hope.  A sense of
wistful regret touches you, as you think about what might have been, and what
will be.
~7~25092~*1207~The Satin Memorial Reading Room~Half read books lie everywhere: Yeats, Tennyson, Chandler, Barrie;
a battered paperback de Laclos; a dusty leather-bound Donne.  A
damp novel perches precariously on the edge of a large bathtub.
As your eyes travel beyond the steam rising to the air toward the
rose-brambled balcony railing, you notice a well-creased printout
of a poem sitting on a the velvet cushions of a rosewood chair
that has been set so as to see the stark black mountains
from one angle, or the wine-dark sea from another.
~4~41480~*1208~A Sea Cave~You are in a small cave in a cliff next to a deep green sea.  Fine
gold and pink sand blanket the floor.  Shells are scattered and strewn
about.  A blow hole in the roof of the cave allows beams of light to stream
in and illuminate the cave.  The wind blows outside the entrance, but
you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been
worn by time into a shape similar to a comfortable chair.
~7~33288~*1209~The Archmage's Workroom~This well-lit room is absolutely filled with clutter -- enchanting gear,
reagents, spell components, ancient tomes, scrolls, braziers, exotic incense
and countless other tools of the magical trade, all jumbled together with
seemingly no attention paid to organization.  You have no doubts that Alander
can find whatever he needs without delay, however.  A heavy oak door stands
barred to the south, to discourage idle visitors, and Alander's quarters
are east.
~7~66568~*1210~Office~The first thing you notice about this office is the floor; it
is a black & white checkerboard pattern, with 8 squares to a side.  The
south wall is a HUGE picture window that produces a magnificent view of
the land.  In front of the window is a large desk.  Completely covering
the east wall is a bookshelf, that is crammed full.  In the northwest
corner, you notice a statue.
~7~33288~*1211~Arena of Judgement~The scene lain before you is one that gives you the feeling of being placed
under a higher authority.  The jury is out.  A statue of Pontius Pilate is
in the aft of the Arena.  Staring balefully, the statue faces a distant
hillside where many aged crosses still stand.  The Arena is set in a wide
pit-like field of trampled bloodstained grass, and is guarded by high walls
of veinous marble.  A bloodstone seat awaits the true paragon of Romanity.
~7~1090056~*1212~The Realm of the Dead~You are standing on an immense, grey stone floor that stretches as far as you
can see in all directions.  Rough winds plunging from the dark, starless sky
tear savagely at your fragile body.
~7~8200~*1213~Asgard~You stand on a huge expanse of glass.  Below you are clouds and the
pains of mortality.  As you stand in Asgard, home of the bravest of the
brave, you are frozen in awe of the power held within these walls.  A
huge mansion lies to the east beyond a set of magnificent golden doors.
~7~327680~*1214~The Room of Lost Souls~This is the room full of souls that never made it to Asgard.  They are
trapped here eternally, left to wander about in misery.  They were infidels
and cowards.  Their cries of misery send a shiver down your spine.
~7~8~*1215~Head of the Rainbow Bridge~Standing on the mortal end of the Rainbow Bridge, the bridge arches up
before you and seems to disappear into the clouds.  You wonder if it is
wise to venture upward into the realm of the gods.  But it seems so calm
and peaceful here that it would be a shame to leave...
~1~32776~*1216~The Entrance of Valhalla~The huge ornate entrance of Valhalla is before you.  It seems as though
atleast eight-hundred soldiers could walk abreast of one another through
these doors. You stare in awe at the sparkling mansion before you.  You
wonder what secrets are held behind these doors and long to hear the stories
of bravery and glory that you know are kept within the walls of Valhalla.
~1~32768~7~8~8~3~You accidentally depress a small stone button.~From hidden holes, gouts of acid spray out at you!~*1217~Valhalla~You are standing in the halls of Valhalla.  Pictures of Odin, Thor, Tyr,
Loki, Freyr, Feyja, and Balder line the walls.  The cavernous hall extends
to the east and west.  Rooms belonging to the gods lie to the north and
south.  There appears to be an exit above you, but you do not know what is
up there...
~7~0~*1218~Valhalla~You are standing in the halls of Valhalla.  Tapestries of the gods line
the walls.  A statue of Odin is here.  The halls continue to the east and
west, and there are doors to the north and south of you.  There is some
sort of exit above you, but you do not know where it leads...
~7~0~*1219~Valhalla~You have reached the end of the halls of Valhalla.  There are heavy doors
on 3 walls.  They lead into the rooms of the gods.  The hall goes back to
the west, and there is some sort of an exit above you.  Torches sputter
softly and the scent of incense is strong here.
~7~0~*1220~On the Rainbow Bridge~You have reached the center of the Rainbow Bridge.  Clouds and mist swirl
around your feet.  The view from here is incredible.  It is little wonder
that the heavens were saved for the gods personal pleasures.
~1~65536~*1221~The End of the Rainbow Bridge~You have reached the end of the Rainbow Bridge.  Asgard stretches out above
you.  Looking around, you search for the legendary guardian of Asgard.  The
clouds are far below you and a sense of beauty and peacefulness surrounds you.

~7~13631496~*177~The Chamber of Femininity~You are in a cosy, exquisitely decorated chamber that has been hollowed
out of the solid underground rock.  Dimly lit torches on all four corners of
the room provide comforting light and warmth, offering a brief respite from
the bitter coldness of the underground.  The smell of perfume permeates the
air, giving the room a distinctly feminine touch.  Yet, in all its
splendour, the room has an indescribably artificial feel about it.  Its
furnishings are perfectly arranged and bear no signs of use, as though
untouched by the reality of time and wear.  
~7~13631496~*155~The Parlor Entrance~You find yourself at the entrance to a relaxing, upscale parlour.  The
tall front desk before you has a large guest list, as well as a stack of
brochures printed in drow script.  On the wall behind the front desk is a
fancy gold logo which amounts to nothing less than the letter "Z".  The
relaxing sound of running water from a small fountain beside the front desk.

Your eyes feast hungrily on
what remains of the light coming from the back room above.  The smell of
mildew and what you believe to be raw sewage wafts through the air.  You are
able to tell that the ground is wet, with maggots and cockroaches roaming
freely.  The constant scurrying of rats and inexorable dripping of water can
be heard around you, with an occasional scream of anguish somewhere in the
distance.  A faint trace of light can be seen off in the distance.  The
passage continues to the north.  
~7~13631496~*167~A dark underground passageway~You are in a cold, dark underground passageway.  The near absence of

details about the surroundings, but you are able to tell that the ground is
wet.  The constant scurrying of rats and inexorable dripping of water can be
heard around you, with an occasional scream of anguish somewhere in the
distance.  A faint trace of light can be seen behind the doors to the east
and west.  The passage continues to the north.

paperwork.  The atmosphere is genuinely business-like, as numerous doors
leading into offices can be seen all around you.  
~7~13631496~*175~An Executive Office Suite~You are in a stately office chamber which obviously belongs to someone of
high standing.  There are tall bookshelves on the east side of the room,
full of books written in the drowish language.  There is a large desk here
upon which piles of paper sit, waiting to be stamped or processed by a
bureaucratic hand.  The floor is covered with exquisite carpetting made from
the fur of some unknown animal.  In the corner of the room is a large
