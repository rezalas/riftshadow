a long serpentine body accompanies slavering jaws dripping saliva that

something to devour.

Ancient trees as wide as a ten feet stretch from the ground to the canopy
unbranched, upon reaching the canopy massive arms spread wide their fingers
straining to gain as much coverage as possible.  Wildlife noises echo
through the forest from trunk to trunk in a weird eerie way.  Light cascades
through the canopy upon each gust of wind, beams of light strike spots
lighting it up for a brief moment before the shifting canopy casts it in
shadow again.

gusts its way up and down the trail, swirling with it lose dirt and the rare
fallen leaf.

Western Trail~
A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots

trail are bushes and young trees waiting for a lucky break when they might
be able to spring up to take the place of a fallen giant.  A strong breeze

Ancient trees as wide as a ten feet stretch from the ground to the canopy
unbranched, upon reaching the canopy massive arms spread wide their fingers
straining to gain as much coverage as possible.  Wildlife noises echo
through the forest from trunk to trunk in a weird eerie way.  Light cascades
through the canopy upon each gust of wind, beams of light strike spots
lighting it up for a brief moment before the shifting canopy casts it in
shadow again.

Ancient trees as wide as a ten feet stretch from the ground to the canopy

Some small vegetation has managed to strangle a tree of its sustenance,
culling its ability to absorb light at the canopy level and enabling enough
light to shine through to provide for those plants underneath it.  Even
patches of grass has started to grow in the fertile ground.  Smaller
wildlife can be seen scurrying from bush to bush as the occasional bird can

Eastern Trail~
A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots
occasional surface through the bare packed dirt.  On either side of the
trail are bushes and young trees waiting for a lucky break when they might
be able to spring up to take the place of a fallen giant.  A strong breeze
gusts its way up and down the trail, swirling with it lose dirt and the rare
fallen leaf.

Ancient trees as wide as a ten feet stretch from the ground to the canopy
unbranched, upon reaching the canopy massive arms spread wide their fingers
straining to gain as much coverage as possible.  Wildlife noises echo
through the forest from trunk to trunk in a weird eerie way.  Light cascades
through the canopy upon each gust of wind, beams of light strike spots
lighting it up for a brief moment before the shifting canopy casts it in
shadow again.

Before a Cool Spring Glade~
Ancient trees have grown excedingly tall with a small shaded glade spring
at their feet.  Smaller bushes line the edged of the spring and even grass
has managed to take hold where the soil is to shallow for larger plants to
grow.  When light manages to break through the canopy above the spring
luminates into a iradescent blue.

culling its ability to absorb light at the canopy level and enabling enough

A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots
occasional surface through the bare packed dirt.  On either side of the
trail are bushes and young trees waiting for a lucky break when they might
be able to spring up to take the place of a fallen giant.  A strong breeze
gusts its way up and down the trail, swirling with it lose dirt and the rare
fallen leaf.

then rapidly climbs into a cliff face that is covered with eight to ten foot
high shrubs.  The breeze is a lot stronger here at the edge of the forest
where the ancient trees hold little cover over the foothill.

A small trail lined with dense bushes on either side snakes its way
across the mountainside.  Sections of rocks have crumbled away making this
trail extremely dangerous.  With the diminished cover of the bushes the wind
gusts are considerably stronger here.  The footing and wind conditions could
make for a dangerous crossing.

Within a Hermit's Abode~
Stepping into this small abode is quiet an outstanding sight, A half
spherical cage grows to about the height of ten feet.  Branches have woven
themselves over and under each other as it guided by some mystical force. 
Upon the ground even the rocks appear to be well worn and in comfortable
looking shapes, a slight rise in the center that is reasonably level appears
to be a table.  Small sunken indentations around the raised section of stone
appear to be cushioned positions to sit.

This natural cavern looks like water at one stage had carved out its
bowls.  When the cavern had neared the surface the pressure had caused a

to flow in a different route.  Long needles of light puncture the darkness
of this cave splintering off in a myriad of shards when it strikes the rocks
strewn over the floor.  The air is still fairly damp and a large amount of
lichen and mosses grow upon the walls.

small plateau leveling off a couple feet above the floor.  Strewn across
