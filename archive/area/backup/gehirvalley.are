A cunning, malicious imp looks about warily.

This imp flies about, appearing quite pleased as it watches the concern
of the elves in the valley, as they search the forest.  It appears to be
attempting to avoid being seen as well, though failing miserably.  As it
passes what healthy plant life that can be seen, it shreds small plants, and
rips gouges in the trunks of older trees.

about for small animals to torture, though without much apparent success. 
Most small creatures seem to have fled this forest already, but little
encouragement is needed for this goblin to keep searching.

~
Typically a creature of larger bodies of water, an octopus this size is
an extreme oddity for such a small, fresh-water lake such as this one. 
Sheltered beneath the waterfall flowing down from the mountains, it must
survive by preying on creatures which are brought downstream here. 
Apparently, it considers you such as well, as it's tentacles reach towards
to for an attack.

You stand along the edge of a small lake, with trees and bushes thick
until merely a few feet away from the water's edge to your north, where the
soil becomes too damp and wet for such plants as the ground level drops
below the water.  In other directions, the forest spreads out among the
valley floor, becoming exceedingly dense to the west, blocking passage.

Beneath a Small Cliff~
You find yourself beneath a small cliff along the lower slopes of Mount
Cim, marking the border between valley and mountains.  Within the valley,
great trees grow out of the moist, black soil.  There are very few younger
plants though, oddly, and a disturbing quiet hangs over the forest.  It
appears possible to climb up the cliff here, or you can head further into
the valley.

You stand among some ancient ruins, a small tower rising up from the
surrounding landscape.  The immediate area is covered with large stones,
many of which likely came from above you, where the tower still stands,
amazingly.  To your north and west, the ground descends into the forested

On the Western Edge of a Lake~
You are at the western edge of the lake, where the mountains block any
further travel in that direction.  The water beneath you here is relatively
sedate, slowly flowing towards the northeast, until it turns into a river,
flowing further into the valley.  The waters of the lake surround you in all
directions but west, and you can see the valley's forests beyond the eastern
lakeshore.

In a Forested Valley~
You are in a broad valley to the east of the mountains.  What little
light that manages to reach this valley between the cliffs is further dimmed
by the thick canopy of trees above you, though the underbrush is small and
sparse.  A disturbing quiet hangs over the forest, making the absense of
wildlife even more noticable.

valley, right until the cliff edge, though you still see little else in the
way of underbrush or animals.

Near an Ancient Castle~
Ancient stones cover much of the ground here, moss and small plants
claiming what is left as their own.  To your west, a great, ancient castle
rises up, looking down over the valley.  Neglect and decay have reclaimed
much of the castle, though most of the outer walls still stand against the
outside world, and it remains an impressive sight.

Near an Ancient Castle~
You find yourself in a small section of forest between the ancient castle
walls, and even older mountains to the north.  Large stones from the ruins,
and nearby mountains are scattered about, some massive boulders the size of
small titans.  This section of forest is relatively thick, however, and you
even see a few birds flying among the canopy.

notice an large mass of stone to your southwest, barely visible through the
trees.

the valley.  The ground here is a much drier, brown soil, unlike the rest of
the forest, and lacks the sense of unease that pervades the rest of the
forest.

activity of the elvish party here is planned and ordered.

You have managed to stumble onto an exceedingly well hidden campsite.

the area carefully arranged to further conceal this area, the campsite is
practically invisible from the outside.  By the layout of the site, it
appears to be often used by someone, with things laid out in sensible,
well-placed patterns.
