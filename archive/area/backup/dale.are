A path through the forest~
You stand on a narrow but well kept trail through the thick woods. The sounds
of animals resound all about you and leaves rustle softly in the wind. Above
you the high tree top canopy blocks out much of the sun, making the region
seem darker than it really is. To the west you can hear the faint sounds of
water splashing. The path leads into a T-junction to the east.

You are suddenly standing before a small tower made of marble. It is hard to
determine it's purpose since there are no windows of any sort and the only
distinguishing feature on it's smooth surface is an oak door leading east
into it. To the west you can see a dark and brooding grove.

is not normally like this, but is more a reaction to your prescence and that
you are unwanted here...there is an oak door leading west outside, and a
staircase leading up into the tower.
