Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.  A small path leads north into the
shadows and back south to the road.

A wide hallway~
You are in a large hallway, wide enough to accommodate several people
standing abreast. The floor here is a swirl of multicolored patterns, in
constant motion.  A huge black obsidian door blocks the way north, it
looks quite sturdy.

The entranceway~
You are at the entrance to the audience chamber of the grand master of
magic. Beautiful tapestries displaying the ancient masters of lore are on
the walls, and the floor is covered with a plush multicolored carpet, which
seems to rustle and move at the touch of your boots.

The audience chamber~
You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.

A dressing room~
You are in a plush dressing room. Fine garments of many styles and some
outlandish colors hang from a rack suspended in mid air at eye level. The
only other interesting feature in the room is a large silver mirror on a
finely crafted gold stand.

The library~
You are in a small cozy looking library. A few well made books sit atop
shelves which span every wall. A large oaken writing table is in the center
of the room with odd papers and parchments on it. The illumination here,
to your surprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

The altar~
You are in a small chapel designed around a beautifully crafted golden
altar. Many icons to lesser deities line the room, but it is obvious by one
glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

A passage~
You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
the fact that it ends in a blinding blue light to the west. On hooks set
into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy of a evacuation.  The magical blue light shines on the
wall...

Skylar's Hideout~
You are in a small, very messy room. An unmade bed is against one wall, and
books and papers cover every available flat surface. Empty beer cans lie here
and there, discarded with total abandon. A few over full ashtrays can be seen
on a desk.
