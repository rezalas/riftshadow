green mist beholder~
A massive ancient beholder~
A massive beholder levitates here.
~
This massive beholder is nothing like you have seen before, its skin is
aged and grey with hundreds of folds and ripples.  Spread evenly over the
whole sphere of flesh are little eyestalks with big bolbus eyeballs that
swivil around looking in all directions.  In the center of this levitating
orb of eyestalk covered sphere of flesh is a massive central eye, lining the
edge of the eye is a massive eyelid folded up.  The corners of the eye ooze
what looks like green mist.  Underneath the massive Central eye is a large
gaping maw, large teeth that have been worn down over the ages line the
edges like a saw blade.  As this unique creatue exhales you can see a slight
green tinge to its breath and the air seems to twinkle and sparkle a litte,
the arcane smell of cast magic issues forth.

of a realm feared black dragon.  The blade is honed from the jawbone and the
remenants of the teeth have been left in the formation of a jaggered
seration down it's length.  The hilt has been forged of the ever durable
adamantite, providing the blade with perfect balance, some wielders have even
commented that it has improved their deftness.

An Icy Trail~
Jagged stones of solid black rock surround both sides of the trail as it
weaves through these mountain passes.  Stones are packed with ice and dirt
to offer a firm landing, yet the chill breeze of the pass offer their own
dangers of coldness.  Foot prints and other impressions within the dirt give
evidence to a well used trail, but otherwise no common wildlife animals have
chosen to frequent these climates.

A Rock Strewn Path~
This trail appears to be wide enough for several men to easily stand side
by side before the mountain walls begin to rise on each side of the path. 
The ground is fairly dry and rocky except for the natural affects of the
weather, and though many areas of the ground remain uneven, well packed dirt
suggests it is used regularly.

A Rough Road~
This road seems to have been formed more by constant traffic than by
actual paving.  The dirt is marked by wheels and hooves, while snow and ice
make it firm and hard.  The jagged black rocks of the silver mines can be
seen to the north.

A Roadblock~
A large, wooden structure has been used to seal off the entrance of the
silver mines from ordinary citizens.  The jagged black rocks of the mines
hide as many secrets as they do silver, and it will be some time before the
denizens of this city allow common folk to enter the mines unattended.
