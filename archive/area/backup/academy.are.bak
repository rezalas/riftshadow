A short, powerfully muscled dwarven blacksmith stands at his forge.
~
Powerful muscles ripple along this blacksmith's body, testament to his
long years spent honing his craft.  Any facial expression he might be having
is largely obscured by his massive, bushy beard.  While many might consider
him short, he is above average height for a dwarf, and clearly he would be
an opponent to reckon with.

The Royal Academy Guard is posted here, checking the papers of adventurers.
~
Covered from head to toe in the burnished armor of one of Cimar's elite
royal guards, this capable warrior clearly seems bored with the menial task
he has been assigned.  He idly watches the passersby, stopping them if they
attempt to leave the Arch without permission.  Checking to ensure that
anyone who seeks egress to the dangerous outfields of the Academy is capable
of putting up a decent fight, only his diligence towards duty keeps him
paying any attention at all.

turns his attention upon you, and his deep brown eyes bore directly to your

its dull eyes sink into their sockets to the point that they can barely be

this animal is a study in contrasts.

standing beneath steady streams of drops, you suspect it's down here to gain
a bit of relief.  It can still, however, spit fire when it chooses...

Welcome to Riftshadow!  That was the Caretaker who just spoke.  He's a
good guy.  A little old-fashioned at times, but a good guy nonetheless.  It
was him that put signs all through this Academy to teach you how to
function, to manipulate this world... and the first thing you need to learn
is how to move!  As does the real world, Shalar has four cardinal
directions: north, south, east, and west.  In order to move in one of these
directions, you need only type "north," "south," and so on.  In fact, you
can get by with merely "n," "s," "e," and "w."  You can also move in two
other directions -- up and down.  This room has an exit down.  Type "down"
(or "d") to move to the next room.

The next thing you need to learn is a little more about exits.  The first
room you were in had one exit: down.  This room also has one exit: east. 
What happened to the room above you?  Well, that's a one-way exit.  You'll
run into those occasionally, and it takes a keen eye to identify them before
you blunder straight through.  Keen eyes are thus fairly important... some
one-way exits will trap you in a place you'd rather not be!  Now, as for the
exit in this room... there's a door barring your way.  For most doors, you
can simply type "open east" or "open north," and then walk through.  Some
doors, however, are locked.  If you find one of those, you'll need the right
key to get through.  First, if you have the key, you "unlock east."  Then,
you "open east" and you're home free!  Give this door a shot.

NOTES ~
E sign~
Every explorer needs to be observant.  You would do well to examine
things at all times, and to read the descriptions you come across... who
knows when some valuable bit of information might pop up?  Many rooms have
extra descriptions hidden where you can't see them immediately.  As you read
a room's description, things might jump out at you as likely targets to be
examined; for example, if a description mentions a huge pile of red onions,
you might "look pile" or "examine onions" for more information.  A lot of
the time, it's the extra descriptions which provide clues as to how you
might interact with objects in this world!  If an extra description mentions
a dog who likes to be scratched, you might try the command "scratch dog." 
Or, if you read about a bookshelf that looks as though it could be pushed,
you could try to "push bookshelf."  There are things like this hidden all
over the place, just waiting for you to find them.  Take this room, for
example...

Many times, you'll encounter an object or a creature or a room that
*seems* like it should have some greater purpose, but does not present one
to you readily.  Much like the bust in the last room, a quick examination
will often yield the results you need.  However, not all rooms feature such
prominent and obvious targets for discovery and manipulation.  Take this
rather featureless room, for example.... Another tool that you'll often want
to use is directional descriptions.  You can look in a given direction and
examine it more closely.  If you're on a road, and you type "look east" (or
"l e") you might see that the road suddenly drops down a sharp decline a
little ways in that direction.  Or if you're in a private residence and you
type "look north," you might see a fireplace mantel with a candlestick
holder that's a clue in some sort of murder mystery.  Try looking in each
direction in this room.

Well, I'd say you've now got a decent grasp of how to move about and
examine your surroundings.  Remember to be observant, and above all recall
that Shalar is a land of magic and mystery... things are often not what they
seem, and the mundane is normally secondary to the extraordinary.  In this
tiny crawlspace, you'll find a portal -- it will take you to the great
Shalaran Academy, where you will be further versed in the ways of the world.
But from the point you step through, there can be no more Caretaker!  You'll
be on your own to discover things, to puzzle out the meaning in whatever you
find, and to use the knowledge you gain to move ahead in your life.  The
body you're in has just come of age within whatever society you've chosen,
but it has a history attached to it -- and you're the one who writes it! 
Were you a blacksmith?  Were you born to a king and queen in some far off
land?  Have you never been to the deep, dark Barren Hollows, and do you fear
them with every fibre of your being?  These are all things you'll have to
determine for yourself, if you haven't already, and keep in mind as you move
out into the world on your own.  No one else will do your thinking for you
from here on out!  Now... as for the portal... you'll find them scattered
about the realm, and you never know where they'll lead!  The command to
enter one is "enter portal."  You know where this one will take you... so
go, and good luck!

The meadow opens to the north and west, while the dense forest blocks
travel to the south and east.  You see a few people nearby, typically
staggering in from the north, and as you watch, many are wounded.  As you

the northern meadow.

Travelling through the meadow, you find yourself in the middle of a
bloody battleground.  The area here is a little calmer than the rest of the
fields, apparantly there is some sort of order to this area of the meadow,

order.  Corpses are strewn all over, though one in particular seems oddly

Things are somewhat calmer here, at least in so much as there is less

Dominating this room is the massive stone archway to the west of the
room.  Leading out into the unknown, you can dimly make out the sight of
tall trees in the distance.  A sign next to the westward arch proclaims that
only adventurers of sufficient might have the permission of the Crown to
enter the hazardous territories.  Clearly this is being enforced by the
guard who stands alert, checking each would-be departure for worthiness.  To
the north there is a large, wooden door with steel beams reinforcing it. 
You can hear the loud sounds of hammering and cursing emanating from it in a
distinctly Dwarven tongue.

The cramped room serving as Jormund's combination of store and forge is
downright tiny.  The heat radiating from the forge borders on uncomfortable,
and what little standing room there is is mostly covered in smithing tools
and implements that force you to duck your head.  Dominating the center of
the room, the huge forge sparks occasionally erupting from it in an
impressive display of pyrotechnics as the squat dwarf hammers away at his
crafts mercilessly.  It's easy to see how this room could inspire
claustrophobia in human-sized onlookers, but Jormund, with his squat
stature, apparently prefers it that way.

The Light of Creation~
Slowly, your eyes open, admitting the warm light of this new world.  You
find yourself awash in the sounds of the sea, as waves break against the
shore and gulls fly overhead -- you turn to watch them, and see nothing but
the light which surrounds you.  Subtly, the sound in the air shifts to
rustling leaves and a crackling fire; the scent of burning wood reaches you,
tickling you further toward consciousness.  As you become fully aware for
the first time, a booming voice strikes out through the white void: "Welcome
to Shalar, young pilgrim.  You have chosen to inhabit this vessel, and I
commend you for your choice.  In the coming minutes, you will become
accustomed to life here; I will guide you by placing signs with the
information you need.  You may look at the very first sign here in this

Abruptly you find yourself plunged into pitch darkness.  Your eyes seem
to widen of their own accord, struggling to take in your surroundings and
adapt to the new level of light.  As they do so, you realize that the room
you have entered is actually quite well-lit, with softly flickering candles
lining each wall.  Numerous portraits and busts fill your field of vision
and stretch off down corridors to the north, south, and west, as far as your
eyes can see.  To the east is a large wooden door.  Glancing upward, you
note that wherever you came from is no longer a viable travel destination.

Your explorations have landed you in what looks to be a closet of sorts. 
Dozens of paintings and statues which seem as though they're in the same
style as those you saw outside are irreverently piled on top of each other
here.  A significant layer of dust covers most everything, and every
movement you make kicks another cloud of it into the air.  The only clean
thing in the room is a bust at the south end of the room, up atop a marble
shelf.  The man depicted wears a tiny set of spectacles and has a
well-trimmed mustache.  Despite the fact that he is carved from stone, you
have the distinct impression that his cold eyes are watching you...

The way you have opened widens into a small, featureless chamber with
flat steel walls all around.  Behind you, the hidden doorway is still
visible, leading to the north.  But in every other direction, cursory
glances reveal no other possible exits.  The sound of dripping water echoes
into this metal tomb, resonating in such a way as to discomfit the
listener... you receive the eerie sensation of being buried alive.  The dim
light here is provided by sources through the door to the north, and it

Whirling around, you see that the north wall of this tiny space is the

though whatever opening you passed through moments ago has closed up behind
you; the wall ripples and shivers for an instant, however, indicating that
you could probably push your way back through to the north if you wanted to.
Turning your attention to the rest of the space you've entered, the design
seems nonsensical until you realize that you are literally between the walls
of whatever structure this is.  In the same instant as this realization, yet
another sign shoots up from the ground, and a huge portal snaps into
existence.

From the way it's been beaten almost completely flat, it's apparent that

which those new to Shalar plummet.  The walls to the north, south, and east

unnecessary.  Above you, a timber-frame style of construction holds the

This hallway has a bit of a claustrophobic feel to it.  The walls taper
together here from both directions, reaching their closest point at a sort
of bottleneck in this room.  Hot air from the Academy rushes by you toward
the temple to the south in a constant, pressing wind.  You feel almost as if
you are being pushed out into the world by some great, warm invisible hand. 
Peering to the north, you can barely make out a junction of hallways to the

in from the rock ceiling's massive weight, but a closer examination shows
that it has likely been broken and reinforced several times in the last
century or so.  There are no lights in this section of the tunnel, but what
comes in from both directions provides plenty to see by; ore deposits of
some sort in the walls reflect the light and glitter like stars in the

Torches line this massive hall, each adding to the chaos of flickering
shadows cast about this room.  A twenty foot high fireplace of reddish stone
roars on the north wall, casting incredible heat throughout the Academy. 
The ceiling here is much higher than in the tunnels to either side; the weak
firelight provides ample visibility on the floor, but strains to reach the
top of the room.  Despite this, you can make out a huge, black, wrought-iron
chandelier which is apparently in a state of disuse.  Behind each torch on
the walls, crude paintings of famous Shalaran heroes to have come through
here for training at some point early in their lives are proudly displayed. 
Dozens of recruits mill through this vicinity, guided by several large men
who look to be in charge; you must move in order to avoid being trampled by
any of a number of herds.

between two huge wooden strut supports, a shopkeeper peers at you
expectantly.  His wares are on display on a countertop of stone, set at
eye-level for a sidhe, and a sign hangs prominently above it.  To the north,
a hallway leads further into the Academy, and to the east, the huge, hot
guildhall bustles energetically.

A Short Hallway~
This portion of the hallway which stretches through the Academy is fairly
cool.  A breeze wafts in from the north and passes gently by, caressing your
skin like a mother would her child's.  Brilliant, flaring torchlight
reflected around the corner from the guildhall southeast of here is still
plenty to illuminate this section of tunnel; as such there are no direct
light sources here.  The result is a strange effect on the walls and ceiling
-- long shadows cover large sections of the rock and vacillate slowly, as if
there were huge black snakes all around you.

The Dispatch~
A large sign on the wall in this room indicates, with a large arrow
pointing to the left, that you may pass into the training cages to the west;
with a smaller arrow pointing to the right, it shows you that you may enter
the "Overrun Area" to the east.  Two small piles of stones here look to have
been delicately arranged; noticing that each stone has a name inscribed upon
it in tiny print, you receive a sudden impression that they signify the
number of people who have died in either direction.  Furthermore, you notice
that the pile on the right is significantly larger.

The Gibberling Cage~
The keening, whining wail of the gibberlings in this room is deafening. 
Through a large barred door to the north, you see one of the beasts...
hairless, toothless, and thumping about on all fours.  Behind it, another
barred door conceals another gibberling.  On the south wall opposite this
cage, a lever practically begs to be pulled.  It takes little imagination to
conjure up an image of what precisely will happen once that takes place, of
course.  To the east, the intersection of tunnels that leads into these
training cages is visible.  West of here, the deeper cages present much more
difficult challenges.

The Goblin Cage~
Here, the cage is filled with goblins.  Wearing nothing but loincloths,
the filthy little beast men lunge at the bars, straining to reach one
another and you.  The goblin which is closest to you in the first cage
breathes with the sound of a dying animal; his frenzied exertions seem to be
tiring him out somewhat, but his beady red eyes remain locked on you
relentlessly.  From the east, you can still hear the wailing gibberlings. 
The sound from the west is far more chilling; a deep howling sound born in
the depths of the Abyss rolls over you.  Another lever is in the wall behind
you here.

The Mastiff Pens~
This, the deepest of the training cages, is the home of the hellish
mastiffs of the west.  Such a far-ranging beast often roams over the
mountains and into the areas surrounding Cimar... in that case, they are
captured and brought here.  The huge animals farther back in the cage bay
and howl incessantly, separated from each other by thick iron bars and
impatient for a good hunt.  The one nearest you, however, remains calmly
seated upon its haunches and stares directly at you, licking its lips
occasionally.  Another lever is in the wall to the south, and east of here
lie the rest of the cages.

The Outpost~
This slick-sided tunnel is walled with panels of wood.  The ceiling and
floor are wood as well, all of it dripping wet.  The sounds of water falling
and flowing echo in from a dim cavern to the east.  It looks as though
you're standing in the last remnant of the Academy's structure before what
is commonly referred to as the Overrun Area... which seems to be a large
natural cavern, punctured by huge root systems which form small caverns and
pockets and tunnels of their own.  Strange, animal sounds creak and croak
from the root-filled caverns, and you begin to sense why new recruits are
gently dissuaded from heading in that direction.

The Entrance to the Overrun Area~
The air in this cavern is thick with moisture so cold and dense that it
feels like a slap on the face every time you turn your head.  Horrible
sounds drift all through the area; what sounds like a corpse being devoured
messily is what sticks out most between sharp, punctuating animal calls. 
The roots here are the size of century-old trees in some places, but dangle
like thick, clammy hair in others.  It's difficult to find any trace of a
trail or any sort of landmarks... one could very easily become very lost in
here.  West of here, you can make out the exit past a curtain of dangling
roots.

A Murky Hole~
More of a wide crack in the floor of the cavern overhead than anything,
this tunnel burrows beneath the root system above and delves deep into the
earth.  Above you, roots dangle, dripping moisture onto your head; below
you, the soft earth gives way as you pass, as though it has been a very long
time since anyone has trodden here.  To the east, a soft glow indicates some
sort of light source, but you cannot determine what it is, precisely.  To
all other sides, you are surrounded by rancid earth and mossy rock.

The Lair of the Mutant~
The walls, ceiling, and floor of this room are all covered by iridescent
moss.  The ethereal yellowish glow generated by it is what lights this
cavern, in a decidedly eerie fashion.  To your east, a small stone tablet
rests against the moss-covered wall of the cavelike fissure, and to the
west, the sound of trickling water emanates gently.  This room stinks of
decay, and occasionally something rustles just out of sight.  Between the
thick, stifling, scent-laden air and the closed quarters, this particular
spot could make most anyone feel slightly claustrophobic.

The stone tablet has written upon it some sort of ancient writing, which

The Mutant's Hoard~
This room was created by hands, dug from the loose earth of this fissure
below the caverns.  It looks like huge clots of dirt were torn free and
thrown to the west, as a large hump of tamped down earth narrows the
entrance considerably.  Strewn around this space, various bits of string and
colorful pieces of cloth are enshrined and lit by more garish yellow moss. 
Stuffed into the ceiling, a broken lamp protrudes downward, crowding
headroom.  A few tiles have been laid on the ground in a meticulous row, as
if in an abortive attempt to create a civilized space.

This small cavern cracks its way from the Overrun Area to the north back
toward sections of the Academy to the southwest.  It looks as though this
area is free from the strange monsters inhabiting the caves to the north,
though you cannot be certain why at first.  However, very soon you note the
thick grease coating the walls and ceiling; the strange smell it gives off
is highly acetic.  Perhaps the beasts simply prefer to avoid this viscous
sludge.  At any rate, this room provides welcome respite, and is equipped
with a large basin full of crystal clear water.

of coming back through the Overrun Area.  To the east, the water basin

Leaving the walls of the Academy, you find yourself in a thick forest. 
The trees rise up as far as you can see, blocking out most of the sunlight. 
The trees, mainly kinds of evergreens, are covered in thick pine needles. 
Between the trees, yellow gleams briefly as you struggle to see what it is. 
The sounds of wolves echo from deeper in the forest.  To the north, the

of ground here shows where someone else made their campfire, but there is no

The forest here begins to thin out considerably.  Light once again
streams in among the trees, revealing the details of the forest.  The
trees's leaves are a deep shade of green, spotted with a bloody shade of
red.  The thick grass contains a black point at its tip, containing its
seeds.  The wind carries ravens and other small birds as they soar around
the tall trees.  The forest grows deeper and darker to the east.  To the

From this hilltop, you can see a large battle in progress.  While the
figures are too far off to make them out, you see a well equipped faction
assaulting a more ragtag band.  The band seems to be defending a structure
off in the distance.  The hill itself is covered in the same grass as the
glade near it.  You can return to the glade to the south or climb down the
hill to the battlefield.

Bloodhawk Meadow~
Exploring your surroundings, you come across a small meadow.  Grass grows
up tall enough to brush against your legs, but not enough to impede travel. 
As you walk about, you notice noises from the north; sounds of combat.  Then
you realize that while the area you stand upon is relatively pristine, the
surrounding meadow has been trampled down and bloodied.  It would seem
caution might be a favorable option.

A Dusty Cave~
Holes dot the walls of this cave, the remnants of mining and magic.  A
small shelter stands in one corner of the cave.  Various mining tools are
strewn on the ground.  You see the faint glitter of gold as the dust floats
through the air.  You can manage to climb your way out of this cave.
