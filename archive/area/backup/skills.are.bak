Gamygyn~
A great barbed demon stands here, somehow shining with black light.
~
A shimmering form which seems at times to dwarf you, and at times to stare
into your face at eye level, Gamygyn is an amorphous being.  His body seems
to phase in and out of existence on this plane; when here, he is a great
being which emanates the light which would be seen if it were possible to
view the sun through a lump of coal.

Orobas~
A demon with an eerily wide smile crouches before you.
~
Orobas is at once young and old, appearing as both a man and a woman.
Beautiful and handsome, he is also hideous.  Shockingly, the number of
limbs his frame contains is uncertain; you simply cannot seem to tell.
Likewise, though you may stare directly into his gaze, you cannot decipher
which of his heads it is that you address.

Geryon~
A gaunt demon with a long, pale, and disturbingly human face stands here.
~
This demon looks almost to be accustomed to the air on the surface of
Shalar.  One might expect a denizen of the abyss to be shocked or upset at
being plucked from its confines, but Geryon is quite at home.  In fact, his
forlorn expression betrays no real angst; a glimmer in one eye tells you
that he is looking forward to expanding his collection of bits of mortals.

Cimeries~
A pig-like winged demon grunts and snarls, displaying many large teeth.
~
At a great fifteen feet in height, this slobbering beast beats its shredded
wings against the air in a vain attempt to take flight.  One might almost
feel pity for Cimeries, were he not a greater demon of the abyss.  Vicious
teeth are set in his jaw at odd angles, and they slash and tear at bleeding
sores upon his face as he speaks.

Looking much like a human necromancer, this demon wears robes of black with
silvery runes imprinted upon them.  His face is ever so slightly drawn back,
however, resulting in a most unpleasant appearance which differs from that
of a human only enough so as to disturb the viewer.

apparantly the Caelumaedani are not satisfied with your current description,
and you have been placed here until your appearance is suitable for an
adventurer.  A number of statues stand in various areas of the room, images
of assorted races that you may wish to look at.  Please excuse the mess.  We

E human~
As you look at this statue, it seems to shift through various images of
humans.  One of the most versatile races, a great many appearances flash by,
but few of the images possess the extremes that some other races have. 
Height varies from under five feet, to around seven in the extremes, with
slim, to muscular frames.  
~
E minotaur~
Looking at this statue, it seems to shift through various images of
minotaurs.  Varying from just under six, to around eight feet in height, the
horns adorning their skulls can often add upwards of another eight inches in
males.  With a typically muscular frame, it is not surprising that the
images of this war-like race often bear weapons of war.  
~
E elf~
As this statue shifts between varying images of elves, there is much less
variance than some of the other races.  Most of the images are around five
and a half, to six and a half feet in height, with a slim build.  The
bulkiest look about a broad as a slightly above average human.  Fair of skin
and hair, the elves have a pale complexion, usually with blonde or silver
hair, though not even the males grow facial hair.
