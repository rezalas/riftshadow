be a fabulous elven city. Remains of what was once great still linger even
here in the rocks and creeping undergrowth. The shattered archway leading
into the city bears the markings of elvish highlords of longpast. To the
east and west you can make out rock strewn paths around the city
battlements. South of here heads into the dark forests.

You are standing up on the rubbled remains of the city walls. The walls are
broken and rubbled, and the walkway around them is dangerous. Cold wind blows
over you and a dark shadow from the surrounding forest seems to cover
everything. The walkway heads east and west.

The courtyard here is shattered and ruined after the devestation of some ages

beautiful marble courts, and the stone fountain is dry and crumbling. To the
north lies the ruins of Myth Drannor. A large collapsed archway heads south
out of the city and toward the surrounding forest.

Under a broken archway~
Above you is a majestic but shattered stone archway. Intricately carved signs
have been cut into it, and fine gems still lie embedded on it's surface. If
ever there was an indication of an abandoned city this is it, gems left here
untouched by even common looters and scavangers that usually haunt ruins. To
the east the ruins open out into a large open space filled with swampish weeds
and wet muddy gorund. In the distant north you can make out the ruins of some
towers.

You are standing in a large open space that appears almost as if maintained

this region, and the destruction is more subdued here. Three towers lead off
from the square here: a green tinted one to the north, blue tinted to the
east and a blood red one to the west. The rubbled ruins lead southwards

You stand on a wide but decayed stone bridge. Large portions of the span have
collapsed into the stagnant black waters beneath it, leaving huge holes that
threaten to swallow any who venture too close. To the south the ruins seem
to have become swamped with water and covered in marsh-like flora. North of
here there is a pile of rubbled ruins, most of which is impassable, but a
small section can be seen cleared away to allow some exploration.

Before a bloody signpost~
Here in the middle of the marshy ruins there is a large wooden sign covered in
dried blood and adorned with blackened and cracked skulls. The ruins to the
north of this sign seem ominous and less disturbed than to the west, and you
notice that almost all the tracks lead out from the north, rather than into it.

At a junction in the swampy ruins~
The wet marshlands that have grown here in the ruined elven city are almost
completely taking over the land. There is very little sign in this part of the
city of what once was, and the way through is blocked by the dense swamp muck
and deep holes of water. There is a wide, cleared path leading east, and a
darker path heading west. To the south the swamps seem to recede a little.

A cold dark room~
You have entered a room of the coldest winter. The air from your breath
freezes upon your lips and your body almost goes into shock from the cold.
There is nothing but ice and darkness in here. A massive green door lies in
the northern wall and a stairwell heads up into the cold night.

massacre that must have occured centuries ago. Scores of large ships and
boats have been totally demolished and left to rot in the bloody, bone
filled waters. Burnt and blasted hulls litter the entire region, and
skeletons of elves hang lifelessly from the helms and bridges of them.
There is no doubt that the forces that blocked and slayed the elves as
they tried to flee were powerful beyond anything seen in recent times. The
smashed boat graveyard is too hazardous to explore, and you can only head

You stand on an isle consisting almost purely of bones from long dead
elves. There must be thousands of bodies piled up here, all left to rot
and decay in the bloody waters. Yet somehow they seem recent, like they
were slain only recently rather than centuries ago. For a moment it seems
the isle shifts beneath you as if the bones were still alive...a chill
through you as you gaze over the isle of bones. To the east and north you
can see the ruins of many ships that were destroyed as the elves tried to
flee the massacre.

On a wet, marshland path in the ruins~
You are on a path through the marshlands that have overgrown the ancient
ruins. There is a faint smell of salty sea water coming from the east,
and to the west the path heads back to a T-junction in the swamps.

Wading through the bloody waters of the harbour~
You are standing knee deep in the red tinted waters of the ancient
harbour. Your steps are made harder by the sucking and clinging mud
beneath the murky water, and the air is warm with the smell of blood.
There are no fish to be seen and there is a total lack of animal prescence
where normally water would attract much attention. Something very
disturbing has happened here, and the power of it still lingers in the
region. The harbour heads east and south, or you can go north onto the
ruined docks.

In a burnt out harbour-master's room~
You are in the ruined remains of what was once the harbour master's room
for this port of Myth Drannor's boats. There is nothing here now but the
smell of blood and a feeling of disturbed peace. It is as if time has
stopped here, capturing the feel and blood of the ancient fall of the
city, rather than being just another dried out hole that you would expect.
You can head south onto the docks.

At the edge of the swampland ruins~
You are at the eastern edge of the ruins amongst the overgrown swamps. To
the east you can make out what looks like the ruins of one of the city's
ancient harbours. Unlike the rest of the swampy ruins the harbour to the
east seems to be relatively free of swamp and forest growth, and there is
the strong smell of salt water, or blood, in the air...
