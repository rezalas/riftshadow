The writing on the parchment relates how the elves of Myth Drannor were used
as sacrifices to provide the pure blood needed to help raise and evil of total
corruption and unspeakable power that lay dormant beneath the city. Thie red
bloodletting was to be accompanied by two other merging powers, that of the
pure magics, the blue energies, and the divine magics, green energies. Yet
something went wrong and now forces of darkness are fighting for the last
keys to the power that lies hidden. Once the red, blue and green are finally
joined the black tower will reveal it's secrets..

This nasty looking scimitar is unlike any you have ever seen before. It has
a far different weight and balance to any other sword you have ever seen, and
it's certainly not a very sturdy blade compared to many you have seen. In fact
it looks quite pathetic as far as weapons go, although the cruel form of it's
serated flesh-cutting edges could do some serious damage to a person's body
if they managed to cut it right.
