Before a massive cave, on the mountainside~
Barely managing to climb the enormous mountainside, you seem to stumble
on to a large creation, set in cold stone.  Before you is a magnificent
sight, a massive hole has been torn into the rockface of this mountain,
forming a dark cave.  The foliage which surrounds the mountain seems to be
parted and destroyed around the cave, giving it an eerie, bare appereance.

Within a slightly-lit cave~
Small rays of sunlight beam in from the south, shedding light to a small
portion of the cave.  The rocks here range from a smooth gray to a slightly
dusted black color.  Though not a single drop of moisture can be seen along
the walls.  The ground below your feet is rather rough, it is quite obvious
that few, if any men, have passed through here recently.  The tunnel
continues to the north, and exits to the south.

Within a dark cave~
It's pitch-black in here, and the only faint bit of light you can see,
shines from the south.  The rocks are almost undetectable, but carry the
same texture and color, a smooth pale gray, to a dusted almost coal color. 
Not a drop of moisture can be seen as these tunnels look very bare.  The
tunnel continues to the north and south.

Before a small intersection, within a dark cave~
Not a strand of light is here, though you begin to feel as though you
are being watched in the cold, dark cave.  At times, you seem to hear a
whisper or chuckle, though it all sounds so faint, that it seems like your
mind is playing tricks on you.  The rocks around here are a bit darker in
shade then the one's seen before the entrance of the cave.  As you feel the
cold, rock surface, you seem to spot a small marking on the wall of the rock
face, it's small in design, below it point two arrows, one to the east, and
the other to the west.

This tunnel is extremely thin, though much like the rest of the cave,
it's very high, the size of at least three adult human males.  The ground
below you is a little smoother, leading you to believe that someone has been
through here recently.  Twisted, jagged rocks protrude from the walls, it's

A dark pool of water, before an enormous cavern~
A small stream of fresh, mountain water, trickles into a pool that has
been freshly dug into the eastern side of the wall.  As the cold, fresh
water touches the pool it turns ebony.  The walls of the cave are a deep,
warm, ebony... they are set in a intricate pattern along the southern
portion of the tunnel, circling around a massive hole, which leads into some
hideous cavern.  Towards the south the faint sound of chuckling and laughter
can be heard.

involving darts.  These devilish creature's are all about you, but they only
seem to eye you curiously, as though they hold back, in fear, to strike at
you for entering their home.

seem to be permanently plastered to their small, petite faces.  Though, they
obviously lack the morale, and spirit to do anything about you invading
their privacy.  The cavern continues to the north and east.

here, are squared and well-kempt, carrying a smooth texture, and a lovely,
granite color.  The faint sound of footsteps can be heard all around you.

part of the passage seems to twist on and on.  Though just as you begin to

western side of the passage are broken and cracked.  Humidity is very fierce
around this part of the passage.  The passage continues to the north, and

forest is poor as the trees and bits of underbrush obscure almost
everything.  The strange gleam gets into your eyes, making it even harder to
see.  The relative familiarity of the path lies back to the north and south.

torn from the ground next to the road.  Broken axes and other tools lie near
the trees, discarded.  The stench rising from the south assaults the nose
with rot, decay, and waste.  It arises from a small, wooden structure,
barely more than a shack.  Red paint splotches indicate the color that was
intended before the painter got sick of the smell.  The road continues to

Much bigger than it appeared from the outside, this grand room expands
out before you in all directions.  People are everywhere, with not much care
for where they eat, sit, sleep, or take care of the other functions of life.
Every now and then among the hordes of poor is a rich traveler who seems to
wonder why they're here.  A potpourri of smells, few of them pleasant, find
their way to you.

A Corner~
The corner appears to be the most popular spot, as those holed up in it
have made it seem like a small fort.  A slight scuffle over space is
constantly taking place.  Blankets and pillows piled against the junction of
the two walls make for the most comfortable bed in the house.  A small
candle on a holder jutting from the wall provides light for the area.

By the Back Wall~
The back wall draws a crowd because of the large stove dominating the
room.  The large, bulbous object exudes heat from the open wire door area. 
Lines of people wait to cook their meal or simply gather the heat.  A large
grass-weave mat lies under the stove, in perhaps not the wisest choice to
ward off fire.  Above the stove, a list of instructions now blackened by the
smoke are universally ignored.

A Small Altar~
This small alcove sits in darkness, with not a candle to illuminate it. 
A short table, no more than two feet off the ground, serves as an altar. 
Two graven images face each on the altar table, one representing the gods of
travel and another the gods of light.  A stained glass window, very out of
place in the hostel, resides in the western wall.  Wisely, a board on the
outside covers it.
