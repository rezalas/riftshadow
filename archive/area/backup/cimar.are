the Common Guild recruiter~
A gentle but hard-faced man stands here, adorned in flowing tan robes.
~
This man looks as though he has seen most everything in Shalar.  He wears
fine tan robes which seem to glow in this warm light despite their somewhat
drab color.  Around the man's waist, a thick rope of loosely woven rags
holds his attire together, and serves as hanging place for his plain steel
mace.  His face, though young, is set with two eyes that seem as
knowledgeable as a god's.  Fair hair and fine skin make him seem far
younger than those ancient, omniscient eyes.  By far his most intriguing
feature, they are a cold, steely grey-blue and presently staring directly
at you.

Gramhagran the armor maker~
A rough man in a thick leather apron tends the forge.
~
Wiping the ash and grime from his hands onto his leather apron, Gramhagran
watches you watching him.  He's a rough man, appearing as one large mass of
callous flesh with a few distinct features and a bit of hair near the top.
Yet despite this, his hands are dextrous and move with expertise and delicacy
in their work while he himself seems cheerful and lightfooted at the forge.
His hands now clean, Gramhagran moves to the counter, eyeing you expectantly.

A tall man with more scars on his face than whiskers stares around his shop.
~
This man looks to have seen many battles in his day.  One eye shot white, the
inflicting wound evidenced by a ragged scar to its north and south, Forl
rolls his good orb toward you.  His face does indeed seem to be a map;  his
brow and cheeks are great continents laced with roads and pockmarked with
cities and lakes.  Rivulets of sweat drag rivers from his widow's peak to his
five o'clock shadow while his hair blots out unmapped terrain.

Tassa the alchemist~
A beautiful woman moves about her shop, unaffected by the powerful smells.
~
It is difficult to determine Tassa's age;  she holds within her an ageless
beauty and grace.  Perhaps the herbs and aromas of her trade have preserved
her over the years, or perhaps she truly is young and her botanomancy merely
accounts for the healthy glow emanating from her skin.  The strange hermetic
atmosphere of her shop certainly leads one to believe it has had something to
do with her current state.  She turns toward you and smiles warmly.

Rising from her perch to meet you, Usiel reveals her svelte figure, concealed
creatively beneath a dark blue gown.  As she approaches, a thin, cruel smile
cracks the porcelein surface of her face.  High arching eyebrows do nothing
to darken her pale features despite their pitch black shade, and long,
straight hair dangles past her shoulders to frame her visage.  Gelid blue
eyes pierce the air between you, and Usiel awaits your inevitable question.

A man with powerful limbs glowers at you from behind his desk.
~
Bare arms glistening in the lamplight, Harlon has obviously been training his
men.  Resting now, he reclines in a wooden chair which screams against his
torturous weight, and props his feet up on the desk in front of him.  This is
a hard man who never sleeps;  as much is apparent simply by looking at him.
Every other man in this bunker hovers near a cot, as though longing for sleep
after a day's work -- Harlon merely glares from his seat, looking very awake.

A flurry of activity surrounds this man as he bustles around his shop.  His
arms, never at rest, fly around him picking up merchandise and probing it for
cracks or holes, then setting it back in place.  Chago is a portly man who
keeps a careful eye on every item in his store, and on every potential
customer who walks in.  As you approach, his face twists itself into the
friendliest grin possible;  his rosy cheeks rise to meet his fading hairline.

here at the Redwater.  She began her career as the serving wench amorous
hands found most often, and has since moved on to assume ownership of the
most well-known drinking establishment in Cimar.  She still has a wonderful
personality, of course, and any jokes about her decline from the days of her

A huge soldier stands here covered in massive plates of armor.
~
This gargantuan human could almost be mistaken for a smallish titan.  The
mounds of armor he wears no doubt enhance his physical stature, but the flesh
beneath is certainly mountainous in and of itself.  He wields a strange staff-
like weapon with a metal loop at one end;  the wooden shaft is roughly three
inches in diameter and between six and seven feet long, but still seems small
in his hands.  A low rumble of a growl emanates from his barrel-like chest
cavity from time to time.

companion, this soldier is fairly small in stature.  He carries an assortment
of light weapons, ranging from daggers and whips to strange multi-pronged
fork-like things and a lariat of rope looped at his belt.  He struts with a
fair bit of confidence, viciously darting to and fro and looking ready for a
fight.  Commonly, members of the Hydra troop are known as "slash artists."

Members of the Gryphon troop are known far and wide for their highly honed
skill with the sword.  This soldier radiates confidence and ability, almost
seeming to have a tangible aura of lethality.  The fluidity with which he
moves speaks of years of training;  to see him handle a pair of swords is to
see art in motion.  Watching him fight, one might be reminded of the wind in
the trees... and this sensation carries over into the simple action of
walking.

Each circle of this man's beautifully wrought ring mail shines with the caught
and reflected vibrance of the sun every day, and the somber blue tones of the
moon by night.  He seems almost an extension of the gods, in such a suit of
armor, portraying their creation in light with piety.  A heavy mace with a
segmented head hangs from his sturdy leather belt, and it swings to and fro as
he circles the guildhall, surveying his students.  His face is liberated of
all grief or pain by his faith in life and the heavens which provide it.

A relatively high-born looking man, narrow of cheek and tall in stature,
almost like an elf, this paladin stands guard before his guildhall with fierce
devotion ablaze upon his young face.  Heavy armor is piled upon his wide
shoulders, making them appear all the wider; leg plates and boots, gauntlets
and a large, overly ornate helm are also a part of his attire.  Yet he moves
determinedly and with purpose, not allowing any amount of discomfort to hinder
him.

contrasted with his long-dead eyes.  Looking as though the most recent life
he's saved was snuffed out centuries ago, this ancient guildmaster teaches by
rote and routine, droning the same lectures time after time.  Not a single
spark of interest flits its way across his visage as you approach, and merely
a hiccup in his mutterings is warranted by your continued presence.  One would
easily be led to believe that any student of his would be hard pressed to
learn much at all, and yet he persists in his position.

embarassed to have interrupted his daily devotion.  His face and robes are

it is in hardened rivulets of wax, resembles nothing so much as a hastily
scrawled ward against demons or a corpse frozen in the rain.

cityguards plopped their headquarters down next door to the old one, and now
the cityguards have moved their operation here as well, following the guild
once more.  Forced into what's barely more than a broom closet, this
particular guild member seems perpetually displeased by his situation.

A pair of cool blue eyes stare out of the shadows at you, calmly ascertaining
that you are no threat.  As you become more accustomed to the darker recesses
of this corner of the square, you can make out more details of his appearance;
his head and neck are wrapped in a long, narrow cloth, presumably to conceal
his identity.  Strapped to his back are half a dozen various weapons, and he
holds a double-edged sword in his hands... the way he handles it speaks of one
completely versed in its every use.

Ever vigilant, this unassuming killer prowls a corner of Kost Square day by

terminating in a sort of angry purplish-red welt on his right cheek.  You note
that the scar runs directly across his left eye, and seems to have narrowly
missed gouging it free or making it useless.

that he is, in fact, smelling each thing his hands retrieve, then returning it

interested in the theft itself than in the goods taken.  His eyes flash as
they fall innocuously toward your pockets.

this area of Kost Square.  Occasionally, you see him totter a bit too close to

lumps, and a large, heavy sag at the bottom sags still lower.

While Cimar contains a wildly varying populace, it is predominantly human.  In
such a city, it is rare to see a non-human in a position of leadership; when
such a person arises, it is likely due to his being a rather extraordinary
specimen.  Such is the case with the sorcerer guildmaster, who now stands
before you.  Ash gray skin smooth as silk covers what flesh is made visible
beneath his voluminous robes, and reddish drow eyes are hooded beneath shock
white hair.  Hands which could belong to a surgeon delicately flip the pages
of a book large enough to tax a titan's arms and befuddle his brain.

A shapeshifter stands here, slowly phasing into new and interesting shapes.
~
One of Shalar's last true remaining shapeshifters, this elderly man looks up
at you as you approach.  Hope shines in his yellow snake's eyes, as though he
thinks to have found a potential apprentice, but as numbing realization sets
in, his llama-like ears droop pitifully.  He slowly turns back to a book which
he has apparently been perusing, and begins the long and painful process of
returning a malformed hoof to the human foot it once was.

has thoroughly convinced himself that the transformation has already taken

~
Hardly the gruesome spectacle of a decaying old man one might expect of
one's necromancer guildmaster, this fair haired human is actually fairly
charismatic.  Arms concealed beneath a floor-length black robe, he looks
like a member of some slightly macabre cathedral choir, with a copy of the
Necromantic Tome for a hymnal.  A brackish, tangy scent reaches your
nostrils just as your eyes waver down toward the packets attached to his
belt... doubtless something hideous is contained therein, to betray his
appearance.

A shade of a man, barely able to hold himself erect, positions himself between
you and the entrance to his guild suspiciously.  As though he were a ghost,
returned to this place after a life of horrible wrongs, he haunts this room
day and night.  His pale skin is stretched over a frame almost sickeningly
lean, and beetle-black eyes peer out of a face like the underside of a corpse.

legs beneath his leggings.  His chest is broad and deep, and he heaves
gigantic weapons to and fro with little effort.  At the same time, his
movements can become immediately graceful and fluid, as though he were
preparing to fight armed with a willow branch.  Little doubt remains in your
mind that this could be anyone other than Cimar's legendary warrior
guildmaster.

remarkable thing about him.  The fingers of his left hand are of the proper
number, but he's missing three on the other.  Despite having only the thumb
and third finger on his right hand, he bustles around handling objects in his
shop with ease.  It's apparent that he's been missing his fingers for some
time, to be so accustomed to it.  He grins wickedly as you approach, and
straightens up next to a pile of trinkets.

A relatively handsome man made more so by his grooming and surroundings, the
middle-aged king of Cimar has the wearying task of surveying a daily parade
of people and problems.  His crown must be heavier than it looks, for it
seems to weigh greatly upon his regal brow.  Jet-black hair shot through with
grayish clumps and streaks crawls from beneath the crown and into a thick
beard.  Occasionally the king's tired eyes glance toward a window for some
sign of evening, waiting for the opportunity to claim fatigue or incontinence
and leave this royal chamber for the day.

The slightest shiver of cold passes through the room as the queen of Cimar
gazes down upon you disdainfully from her golden throne.  As the king's third
wife, she is fortunate indeed to be in such a position; her opinion of
herself is far from afflicted by this fact, however.  A narrow face set with
high, thin cheekbones and watery green eyes is framed by the elaborately
styled, crane-shaped hairstyle that all of Cimar's most aristocratic ladies
are wearing this year.  The queen seems almost to change her gown several
times per day; presently, she wears a frightening assortment of fur and silk.

Waddling about his abode, the captain of the cityguards is the model to which
all of his subordinates aspire.  Living under the burden of a great profusion
of wealth, he spends his days lazing and loafing, hoping not to be forced
into any real labor.  Most of his responsibilities are delegated to the
Cimarrite Army battalions at the eastern edge of the city, and as a result,
while most cityguards resent soldiers and whisper as they pass, this man
revels in their presence.  Their willingness to make certain the city is safe
means one less thing to have to weigh upon his already taxed mind, after all.

Hooting and hollering to himself, accustomed to a certain degree of privacy
on the secluded Cimar docks, the dockmaster wanders up and down their length.
Surveying the numerous beautiful (and expensive) ships moored here, he takes
a moment to greet each one as he passes; most often, the greeting is a
traditional dollop of phlegm spattered across the bowsprit by a mighty
expulsion of air.  The dockmaster's missing eye and leg are a mystery, but
one might safely assume they were lost either at sea many years ago or to a
boat owner angry at having his property expectorated upon.

type of danger and horror Shalar has to offer.  His experience is evident
upon his face, where barely a thumb's width of skin remains untouched by deep
and ragged scars or severe burn marks... or both.  One of his eyes is
painfully obviously no longer one of his original orbs; it bulges outward
from an unnaturally wide socket, peering over a deformed and half-missing
nose at some indeterminate point in space before him.  His other eye,
however, is frighteningly alert.

king cimar~
the king of Cimar~
Lying prone in bed, the king of Cimar sleeps the sleep of rulers.
~
Not one to be awakened by anything short of an earthquake (or his wife's
shrill voice), the king slumbers peacefully.  In fact, his face is free of
the tension which usually inhabits it, and it is only at night that his
regal features surface and show him to be of noble birth.  He looks more
like a king now than during the day.

queen cimar~
the queen of Cimar~
The slumbering queen of Cimar sneers angrily as though dreaming unpleasantness.
~
Her delicate face twisting and contorting painfully, the queen cycles
between expressions of extreme anger and barely-endurable sorrow.  It is
plain that she is experiencing a night terror of some sort.  A slight
whimper escapes from her exquisite lips from time to time, and her delicate
brow creases in worry.  Then, she takes the visage of a demon, and becomes
less a woman asleep than her waking self.

A fisherman is seated at the edge of the bridge, plundering the river.
~
Blissfully unaware of his surroundings, this fisherman happily spends his
day casting and reeling, casting and reeling, occasionally giving his line a
tug to sink a hook and land a catch.  Never peering skyward to note the
weather, nor around him to watch the crowd, he spends his lazy day plucking
fish from their river.

gryphon trooper soldier man~
a Gryphon trooper~
A strong and confident soldier stands here, his hands resting upon dual hilts.
~
Members of the Gryphon troop are known far and wide for their highly honed
skill with the sword.  This soldier radiates confidence and ability, almost
seeming to have a tangible aura of lethality.  The fluidity with which he
moves speaks of years of training;  to see him handle a pair of swords is to
see art in motion.  Watching him fight, one might be reminded of the wind in
the trees... and this sensation carries over into the simple action of
walking.

A huge soldier stands here covered in massive plates of armor.

This gargantuan human could almost be mistaken for a smallish titan.  The
mounds of armor he wears no doubt enhance his physical stature, but the flesh
beneath is certainly mountainous in and of itself.  He wields a strange staff-
like weapon with a metal loop at one end;  the wooden shaft is roughly three
inches in diameter and between six and seven feet long, but still seems small
in his hands.  A low rumble of a growl emanates from his barrel-like chest
cavity from time to time.

companion, this soldier is fairly small in stature.  He carries an assortment
of light weapons, ranging from daggers and whips to strange multi-pronged

The War Chamber~
This chamber is what you would expect for a warrior's guild... padded
training dummies are mounted on the walls and massive racks of sharp
implements of war and burnished steel armor decorate every square foot of
the room.  In one corner is a barrel of water, and hanging from the rafters
are sacks of drying fruit.  As barbarians and swordmasters walk through,
you note that they all have at least one thing in common:  they appear to
be very, very well trained.

A Sun-Baked Yard~
This is a square patch of dirt, about twenty or thirty paces on a side,
and a quick glance around the area reveals nothing of note aside from the
man standing at the northern edge.  The loose, dry dirt of the ground
beneath you has been baked by the sun for years, all nutrients burned from
it by the heat.  It is dead soil, and it seems to have been raked neatly,
and fairly recently.  Here and there you see a few flecks of blood where
the rake did not quite clear the ground thoroughly enough, and tiny shards
of steel and wood litter the edges of the yard.

A Pile of Rocky Debris~
Having hurled yourself from atop Cimar's great northern wall, you can now
see how so many armies have dashed themselves against it over the last few
centuries without any discernible effect.  It stands very high and quite
indomitable, towering over you as you lie prone considering your recent
actions.  With luck, some passerby will notice your broken form and come to
your aid, but for now you lie helpless, thanks to your rash decision to
leap from the parapets.

Atop the North Wall of Cimar~
You scramble up the pile of trash, and find that it's a relatively short
hop from its apex to the top of Cimar's huge outer wall.  And now that
you're here, you can see almost everything in Cimar - this wall is very,
very high.  From this vantage point, you can make out every building in
High Cimar, nestled among the foothills of Mount Cim.  You can see the tiny
people dodging each other in Cimar's business district, the trees at
Cimar's center where the ranger guild makes its home, the frothy point
where the Talis River plummets from the top of a cliff into the ocean to
the south, and even some of the larger boats in the harbor.  From here, the
city's corruption and general state of decay are things unseen and
unminded, and Cimar is once again a grand and beautiful thing.  To your
south, you can climb back down the pile of trash and to your north, a very
sudden drop leads to some extremely sharp rocks at the base of the wall,
more than forty feet down...

#2404
New Cimar~
You stand in the strip of homes and plots of land between Cimar's outer
and inner walls.  It's known as New Cimar in polite circles, and sometimes
as Leechtown or Fungusville in impolite ones.  It houses some of the lesser
families of Cimar, in their smaller homes and less extravagant businesses,
but also holds in its confines the powerful and world-renown mage guilds of
Cimar and the highly trained Cimarrite Army.  For now, though, these things
are at the back of your mind as you kick your way through the litter and
debris.  To the north, a large pile of garbage stands up against the
northern outer wall.  East, the sound of crashing bodies and slashing
weapons is growing louder.  To your south is Toller Road.

You have to kick litter out of the way to look, but the cobblestones in New

wants to use them.

#2405
The Eastern Arch~
The massive stone walls of Cimar open here, forming an archway through
which its inhabitants and visitors pass when entering or leaving.  Gates
which look as though they would take a small dragon to tow open and shut
stretch forty feet over your head.  The traffic here has worn the
cobblestones under your feet to a smooth surface, almost flat and nearly
shining, reminiscent of dulled and unpolished marble.  Several of the
city's complacent Watchmen lounge at the edges of this massive contour,
glaring at passing members of the Cimarrite Army.  The street stretches off
to the west, and becomes a major trade route leading into the east.  Noisy
barracks lie to the south and the sound of clashing weapons floats in from
the north, while Mount Cim dominates the entire setting from the sky to the
northwest.

The gates, while inherently less impressive than the Eastern Arch itself,
are still quite an impressive site.  Finding trees the size of these
massive beams would be a task in itself, let alone assembling them.
~

You can scarcely believe such a thing has been built... but yet, there it
is.  Taller than most buildings in the city, this unsupported arch somehow
supports not only its own massive weight, but that of the portion of the
wall which stretches above it.

#2406
East Toller Road~
This is the main road in Cimar, running east and west its entire length.
Off to the west, you can see that it stretches through the Inner Gate and
over the river toward a vast marketplace.  Though you can't see the road
beyond that, the inner wall on the other side of Cimar is barely visible.
Just a bit to the east, the massive Eastern Arch towers over you.  To the
north, you can hear the sounds of weapons crashing together as warriors
train, and to the south you see the Cimarrite Army's barracks in a long
row.  Bustling traffic buffets you from all sides here as business moves in
and out of the city, and from sector to sector.  Keep moving, or pay the
price and be buried alive beneath a mountain of sweaty, hurrying flesh.

The North Bridge~
Huge old steelwood beams, as thick as an abyss titan's leg and as smooth
as an elf's posterior, make up the North Bridge and allow Toller Road to
pass over the Talis River.  The river swells here, running high toward the
waterfall to the south, and the bridge is barely a foot above water level.
You feel no hazard, though, as passing horses, carriages and titans do not
even cause the beams beneath you to shudder slightly.  The edge of the
bridge is to your north, guarded by sturdy handrails, and you can see the
other edge of this very wide bridge ten yards off to the south.  East of
you lies Toller Road, and the bridge continues to the west.

Huge old steelwood beams, as thick as an abyss titan's leg and as smooth

pass over the Talis River.  The river swells here, running high toward the
waterfall to the south, and the bridge is barely a foot above water level.
You feel no hazard, though, as passing horses, carriages and titans do not
even cause the beams beneath you to shudder slightly.  The edge of the
bridge is to your north, guarded by sturdy handrails, and you can see the
other edge of this very wide bridge ten yards off to the south.  West of

The Talis River~
The crystal waters of this river come from the plains and mountains to
the north as clear and gelid as any in Shalar.  By the time they reach
southern Cimar, they've taken a slightly amber hue, and are noticeably more
opaque than at the northern end of town, but are still relatively clean and
healthy waters.  The tiny bubbles and distortions in the water's seemingly
peaceful surface belie the illusion of placidity by speeding downstream at
an impressive pace.  Near the South Bridge, the water finally begins to
stir, and as it reaches the southern portcullis, it tumbles into rapids as
it topples over a waterfall to crash into the ocean's shore below.  Here at
the northern portcullis, however, the still-smooth waters slip through the
iron bars quietly.

The Obsidian Shrine~
Everything in this room is made of the blackest stone you've ever seen.
A square column of the light-absorbing rock stands at each corner, and the
door is framed with wide slabs of it.  The floor and even the ceiling are
pieced together with massive squares of obsidian, and a large table-like
structure in the center of the room is its only embellishment - also
crafted of black stone.  The table has deep gouges along the top, running
down the edges to hollowed out sections at each corner.  Weathered leather
straps and metal chains and hooks garnish it about every face, and appear
to be the only non-obsidian items in the room.  Gaping at the table and its
accompanying implements, you can only imagine what its full use might be.
To the south is another darkened doorway.

The Obsidian Monolith~
This is the room where necromancers from all over Shalar come to meet and
refine their abilities in the dark arts.  Cimar's necromancer guild is
known around the world, and glancing about this room, you can tell why.
The quality of the glass golems of the necromancers here shows in the way
the bloody light from a torch in the corner refracts through their bodies,
and the intricate detail in the hex dolls hanging from the walls is
magnificent.  Ruddy streams of daylight peer in around the guildhall's
obsidian monolith where it punctures the ceiling.  And what stands against
the western wall, but a route through which necromancers might escape to
the river from the torch-wielding mobs that come knocking!  Truly, this is
one of the finest guilds you've ever seen.

Rantid Road stretching to the west, across a river and into what looks to
be a bustling business district of some sort.  Dominating the sky to the
northwest is Mount Cim, thrusting upward into the atmosphere, where it
punctures the cloud cover and continues toward the heavens.  Below you, the
stones are worn through to a far older rock layer beneath.  East lie the
outskirts of Cimar.

East Rantid Road~
This street was once called Main Street by the original Cimarrite
settlers, and runs through the heart of Old Cimar.  Since the city has
expanded, and since the advent of highways and trade routes, Rantid Road
has fallen into a state of relative disuse.  Compared with the incredible
traffic of Toller Road, this street is calm and picturesque.  The
cobblestones making up the road are worn and cracked at the edges, and make
a uniform surface of smoothed stone.  In the center, the cobblestones have
come entirely away in many places, revealing occasional glimpses at the
ancient slate pathways which preceded even Old Cimar.  The road continues
to the west through the inner wall and into the center of Old Cimar.  To
the east is the south-east gate of Cimar, and to the north and south lies
New Cimar.

healthy waters.  Here, behind the infamous Cimar necromancer guild, is
where most of the pollution comes from.  The tiny bubbles and distortions
in the water's seemingly peaceful surface belie the illusion of placidity
by speeding downstream at an impressive pace.  Near the South Bridge, the

The Talis River~
The crystal waters of this river come from the plains and mountains to
the north as clear and gelid as any in Shalar.  By the time they reach
southern Cimar, they've taken a slightly amber hue, and are noticeably
more opaque than at the northern end of town, but are still relatively
clean and healthy waters.  The tiny bubbles and distortions in the
water's seemingly peaceful surface belie the illusion of placidity by
speeding downstream at an impressive pace.  Near the South Bridge, the
water finally begins to stir, and as it reaches the southern portcullis,
it tumbles into rapids as it topples over a waterfall to crash into the
ocean's shore below.

one another out of the way to get there.  There are a few scattered homes
to either side of the road, but they've been pushed to the side and crushed
into submission by the large guilds to your west.  The traffic on this
street, you now see, is mostly of the arcane and magical sort;  the
occasional sound of a roaring animal or the deafening crack of instantly
frozen water fizzle and pop through the air as you walk.  Turning your
attention to the guilds themselves, you see that they are stacked atop one
another and clustered together in odd formation, strange flashes of light
emitting occasionally from certain windows.  You shiver to think that
within those walls lurk the ability to summon the elements, to change
shape, to divine the bleak sense behind all of creation, weave it together
into a logical progression, and understand what the gods have done with

ceiling and walls aren't caving in, and the floor is level.  The windows
let in a significant amount of light, and you can see that the panes of
glass are clean and new, unwarped by time, and free of any spidering
cracks.  Once you take in the quaint home visually, you note the fact that
there is very little noise here.  Near the intersection of Rantid Road and

New Cimar~
You stand in the strip of homes and plots of land between Cimar's outer
and inner walls.  It's known as New Cimar in polite circles, and sometimes
as Leechtown or Fungusville in impolite ones.  It houses some of the lesser
families of Cimar, in their smaller homes and less extravagant businesses,
but also holds in its confines the powerful and world-renown mage guilds of
Cimar and the highly trained Cimarrite Army.  For now, though, these things
are at the back of your mind as you kick your way through the litter and
debris.  To the north, a very dark alley begins, and to your east and

The Leap of Faith~
Standing here, you find that you can see directly through a gate in the
outer wall and stare straight across the sea.  To either side of you, homes
are set against the massive wall, but this short spurt of a road opens between
them to this inexplicable door... leading to thin air.  Looking over the edge
of the street, you see a twenty or thirty foot drop down a sheer cliff to the
rocky shore below.  Salty, reddish water churns itself into a thick and almost
blood-like foam far below your feet, and it's easy to feel slightly
disoriented staring down in this fashion.  Turning your focus back out to the
crimson sea past your cliff, you squint but cannot discern much through the
ocean mist cutting off perception a few miles off the shore.  The close
proximity of the mage block implies that this gate is used to test magical
flying abilities in a trial by fire.

A Pleasant Home~
This hut-like dwelling seems not to have had its life choked from it by
the surroundings, like many other homes in New Cimar.  Unfazed by the
constant noise, the stench, the litter, and cityguards and soldiers running
about, its inhabitants look to be quite happy.  An expensive looking carpet
covers the entire floor, and quality lamps dangle from each corner of the
ceiling.  A dresser is posed in one corner, with a very well formed clay
pot and basin for washing.  The windows even look new, unblemished, and
free of fractures.  Given what you know about the rest of New Cimar, it's
quite remarkable that someone with enough money to put together such a home
would bother to do it here.  To your west, the door leads back out into the
city.

A Small Home~
This modest dwelling is where someone new to Cimar has made his or her
home.  Nestled inside Cimar's massive outer wall, it's right in the middle
of the rather undesirable plot of land which is New Cimar;  between the
cityguard headquarters and the army's barracks however, there's very little
traffic, creating a surprisingly relaxed environment.  Looking around, you
note dozens - perhaps hundreds - of personal affects strewn about,
decorating every possible flat surface.  The walls are covered with
paintings and maps, the tabletops and shelves are buried under delicate
porcelain and rough hewn dolls.  To the north is a quiet bedroom.

This unassuming bedchamber is dimly lit by candles at each side of the
head of the bed.  The wall to the east is cracked for the entire floor-to-
ceiling length, and cold air flows in through the gap from the tight cool
space between walls.  As a result, the room is pleasantly cool despite the
sometimes oppressive heat of New Cimar's activity.  The bed is simple but
appears quite comfortable, with ragged and patched sheets covering it.  A
very few personal affects adorn a chest of drawers with a large mirror -
which, despite its obvious wear, is quite a distinguished and expensive
thing for a denizen of New Cimar to own.  Back to the south, the rest of
the house glows warmly.  Through a hazy window to the west, you can make
out the motion of passersby on the street outside.

The peace and quiet in this comfortable yet spartan dwelling are almost

down to create an almost forest-like effect.  The air is warm and moist,
and reeks heavily of the sweet scent of pure oxygen.  A few plain brown
pillows rest on the floor, and a single small bookshelf sits against the
back wall.  None of the noise from outside this room intrudes within;
whether by some effect the dozens of plants produce or by a magical
enchantment, this is a perfectly quiet abode despite being across a busy
street from the mage block and right next to some very noisy and dirty
homes.

last desperate attempt to mark something as their property.  You can see
rags, but you remain unsure as to whether they are used as clothing,
bedding, or bandages for rotting lepers who now run naked and free through
the polluted streets.  Flies in the air buzz in circuitous routes, as
though avoiding the deadly hand of stench which wafts here and there
listlessly, occasionally brushing by your own nose.  From one corner, you
hear a coughing fit which subsides into restless sleep, and beneath a pile
of mildewed blankets at your feet, something rustles briefly into

Entering this area, you are assaulted from every angle by a sudden flood

famous mage block.  Every type of mage, theurgist, and student presents
his or herself here, from the lowliest novice seeking words of
encouragement, to the young scholar on his way to purchase required
reagents, to the seasoned and intimidating crowd of learned magi who strut
and pose for one another in the prime of their lives.  Colors and lights
flash in mesmerizing patterns, while the din of excitement and the smell of
danger are occasionally punctuated by the explosion of some concoction or
the scream of an unhappily summoned elemental demon.

The Open Ledge~
This is the place Cimar's shapeshifters call home.  Natural stone, or at
least something constructed to look like it, makes up a sort of cliff or
ledge which juts out from the top of the mage block.  Open air flows freely,
and sunlight beats down during the day.  A shapeshifter might freely assume
the form of a plant or animal and stay here quite happily.  In fact, many of
the plants you see here now may be quietly practicing shapeshifters.  Scorch
marks and missing chunks of stone might be attributed to elemental forms,
while most of the piles of dung are likely from the animals, one would hope.

The Unused Guild~
This is an as-yet-unoccupied guild, though recently several fellows from
the continent across the sea to the south have been eyeing up the property,
and using strange magic in full view of the mages downstairs.  Perhaps this
room will soon be put to good use.  For now, its dusty corners and
cobwebbed ceiling are a bit depressing.

The Mage Block~
Entering this area, you are assaulted from every angle by a sudden flood
of people.  People of all ages, races and creeds carom through the area,
looking for whatever they need (and will most likely find) here, in Cimar's
famous mage block.  Every type of mage, theurgist, and student presents
his or herself here, from the lowliest novice seeking words of
encouragement, to the young scholar on his way to purchase required
reagents, to the seasoned and intimidating crowd of learned magi who strut
and pose for one another in the prime of their lives.  Colors and lights
flash in mesmerizing patterns, while the din of excitement and the smell of
danger are occasionally punctuated by the explosion of some concoction or
the scream of an unhappily summoned elemental demon.

The Elemental Tower~
Rising out from the mage block, this mighty tower room stands as a symbol
of ability, of power and might... of supremacy lorded over all other guilds.
The highest point in Cimar (save for its walls, the temple, and palace of
High Cimar, of course), this is quite simply the most intimidating and
impressive of structures in the city.  Elemental magics of all kinds are
practiced here;  smoke and mist fill sections of the room, while ice and
mud coat the floor in other places.  Wisps of fire and snow dance a
sophisticated tangle of a pattern through rapidly moving air, and
electricity crackles along the walls.  Powders and liquids and reagents
are in both ready supply and heavy odor.  Surely, the magic practiced in
this most pungent of rooms must be superior.

Burning with the cold fire of hard clear crystal, everything in this hall
shimmers and sings the high pitched song of ageless beauty.  The walls and
ceiling are not entirely crystal and transparent;  there is a highly ornate
layer of the material covering the insides of the walls.  The solid wall
behind seems to be covered with mirrors to enhance the effect of the
crystal pillars, columns and ornaments, but you can't quite tell where the
refraction of light by the crystals ends and the reflection by a mirrored
surface beneath might begin.  Even the floor and ceiling of this room are
cold hard diamond in nature.

This room is filled with clocks of all shapes and sizes.  Staring around
in awe, you can see what must be at least a thousand of them;  nearby, a
grandfather clock the size of a titan, tiny clocks with birds for numbers,
clocks shaped like logs of wood and tin cans and even one made of a steel
plate which covers an entire wall, with six-foot-long claymores as hands.
The ticking and tocking is almost deafening, and you realize this might be
a poor place to stand at the hour.  This is the main chamber of the
dwelling of the Master;  the superintendent and landlord of the mage block
across the street.  This room is rather awe inspiring, but merely a shade
of the Master's powerful personality.

finally crashing down Cimar's cliff to the rocky shore of the sea below.
Above you, the massive outer wall stretches up and appears to touch the
sky;  it blots out half the stars on a clear night and keeps this balcony
in the shade for most of the day.  To your east, the red cliffs below you
stretch off along the shoreline, with the outer wall perched atop them for
quite a distance until it finally pulls away to turn north out of sight.

water working itself into a thick foam, crashing against the shore again

the north as clear and gelid as any in Shalar.  By the time they reach
southern Cimar, they've taken a slightly amber hue, and are noticeably
more opaque than at the northern end of town, but are still relatively
clean and healthy waters.  The tiny bubbles and distortions in the
water's seemingly peaceful surface belie the illusion of placidity by
speeding downstream at an impressive pace.  Near the South Bridge, the
water finally begins to stir, and as it reaches the southern portcullis,
it tumbles into rapids as it topples over a waterfall to crash into the
ocean's shore below.  A bridge crosses the water directly to your south.

serves as the entrance to a very disgruntled anti-paladin guild.  A very
cramped space, it has a small door leading west into what was until recently
an abandoned stone building, and a trap door to a stone staircase which
descends into a forgotten basement.  Gelid air billows up from the stairs,
blanketing the area in a chilling wind.  Looking around, you see that the
cityguards have deigned to use this room as a broom closet and storage for
their rusty armor and weapons.  Peering down the stairwell, it is possible to
see the dim flicker of torchlight, and to hear the sound of heavy footsteps
moving around.

huge, disfigured shadows on the wall opposite the torch;  ghastly phantoms of
darkness, silently leaping back and forth through the air.  Flickering light
also touches on a large bar made of the same stone as the rest of the ancient
building.  It looks as though this mound of stones was originally some sort of
table.  And, given the cryptlike appearance of this underground catacomb, it
would be a safe assumption that the "table" was, in fact, a stand for a body
or casket.  And now it's being used as a bar.  Truly an anti-paladin abode.

This short hallway is at the back of a tiny building the cityguards use as

outer wall, and slightly below the Talis River's water level.  As a result, it
is a very dark, wet, cold place.  You can see your breath in the air here, and
hear little but your footsteps clattering against the stone floor along with
those of several rats.  To the north and west, steel bar doors lead to tiny
jail cells, and to the east, the main room of the cityguard headquarters
awaits.  South of here, the outer wall of Cimar actually serves as the wall of
this building as well.  Nobody seems worried that any occupants of the cell to

hewn stone cemented in place by heavy mortar and rusting iron strut supports.
No windows grace the cell's walls, and the only source of light is through the
cityguard headquarters.  Tiny reflections of light from the outside make it
this far into the building, bouncing from pools of filthy water on the floor
outside the cell.  You hear the sound of dozens of tiny rat feet scurrying
about, and the occasional raised voice from another cell or elsewhere in this
compound.  Aside from those, the only noise that meets your ears is the
constant dripping of water.

New Cimar~
You stand in the strip of homes and plots of land between Cimar's outer
and inner walls.  It's known as New Cimar in polite circles, and sometimes
as Leechtown or Fungusville in impolite ones.  It houses some of the lesser
families of Cimar, in their smaller homes and less extravagant businesses,
but also holds in its confines the powerful and world-renown mage guilds of
Cimar and the highly trained Cimarrite Army.  For now, though, these things
are at the back of your mind as you kick your way through the litter and
debris.  To the north, an arch in the inner wall leads to Old Cimar, and east
of that, the wall makes ready to cross the Talis River by way of a grand
arch.  To your east, a small bridge crosses the river, and to the west stands
the cityguard headquarters.

of some sort.  To the south, the inner wall of Cimar separates the old city
from New Cimar, and a large gate opens in its expansive length to allow

This road had a name, centuries ago.  At some point between its naming in

passed on to the afterlife.  And so, as its cobblestones have faded into
nothingness, so has the memory of this path's place in the city's history.
Now, it is part of a tiny core of untouched, undeveloped land at Cimar's

dirty old path are the sole remnant of the original Cimarrite trade town,
built upon the ruins of an even more ancient city.

A tiny wooden shack stands here, with a small stone firepit just outside.
Smoke curls up and around the roof of the shanty, filling the area with the
scent of burning wood and cooking meat.  A tree stump to one side has been
hollowed out and looks to be used as a chair.  A few bushes have bits of
leather hanging from their branches, drying in the sun.  To the north and
west, a beautiful grove grows, the center of the tiny forest which is itself
the center of Cimar.  East and south of here, the forest continues.  Above

In this part of the grove, a large clearing has been opened, almost as if
the trees now at its edge hold a reverence for the massive, gnarled old oak at
its center.  It is impossible to discern the oak's age simply by looking at
it;  its bark is deeply creased and very thick, and moss grows over almost
every square inch.  To the west, the grove continues, and to the south, a
small outpost is set up within the tiny forest.  East and north of here, the
trees have grown too closely together to see much beyond them;  almost like a

A Lonesome Grove~
The saddest songs heard in bars around Cimar are sung of the Heart of Kost.
A huge grove of trees at the very center of the city, the Heart was lovingly
tended to by each and every citizen of that ancient metropolis.  It was
considered to be that which held Kost's walls against a thousand armies, which
led the city to thousands of years of prosperity, which made the gods smile
down upon Shalar.  And then, in the Great War, it was lost.  This tiny
collection of venerable trees, tightly banded in the center of Old Cimar, is
all that remains of the once-thriving Heart of Kost.  Up against Cimar's inner
wall and only a few feet from its bustling business district, civilization is
closing in on all sides.  None of the citizens care for it enough to let it
thrive again, and only the rangers who live here now tend to it at all.

Here, the grove at Cimar's center opens, and a small pond lies serenely
between hillocks covered with lush, green grass.  The trees grow on all sides,
very thickly in places -- almost like a wall -- and only a few small breezes
make their way through to dance politely across the surface of the water.
With a dainty ripple here and a delicate ruffle there, the glasslike pond is
disturbed only occasionally.  Very few large animals venture this far into the
city, but those that do discover a perfect watering hole.  Many small animals
live their entire lives in this grove, and birds of all sizes wash themselves
at the water's edge.  East of here, a small outpost rests between the trees,
and to the north, the grove continues.  Over the wall beyond the trees to the

A Hidden Attic~
This tight space is not something one would expect to find in Cimar's
palace;  particularly not directly above its throne room.  It is unlit, but
from the light that streams in around the door above you, you can see
rather well.  The room is indeed cramped, but in one small indulgence, the
palace's architect has created it from the same rare white marble which
makes up the rest of the extravagant building.  A few drops of wax here and
there make it clear to you that this passage is occasionally used (and the
way lit with a candle), though it has not been in some time judging by the
coating of dust on top of the dried droplets.  Perhaps it is an escape
route which has been forgotten after years of peace in the city.

The flat white marble surfaces of the rest of the palace can't compare to
what this room has to offer.  Here, at the throne, intricately carved
statues and columns line the walls, and the entire floor appears to be one
large slab etched with a highly detailed map of Shalar.  The throne itself
is also constructed of white marble, a lace-like latticework of designs
which seems so feathery and light that it couldn't support a man's weight -
and yet, it is where the king sits daily to dispense his wisdom and
rulings.  At the top of the elaborate chair perches a stylized boar with a
too-large head and huge teeth, its glistening marble tusks protruding
perhaps a bit farther than they should.  To the east, a blindingly white
archway leads to the main room of the palace.

The Palace of Cimar~
Brilliant white marble makes up every surface of this palace.  A mirrored
ceiling reflects you and everything around you from above, and the marble
surfaces all around provide more reflective surfaces to confuse your eye.
Aside from the throne gates to the west and large portraits to the north and
south, there are no features in the area to counter the bright swirling stone
which comprises both floor and walls.  Your footsteps clatter noisily
against the polished floor and echo for what seems an eternity, finally
slipping into silence.  The edges of the marble blocks which make up the
walls are elaborately gilded, while the floor is simply solid white.
Attractive candle formations and intricate crystal chandeliers keep the
room well lit, and the entire place is a reminder of the riches of Cimar's
highest seat.

The Palace Gates~
The gates of the palace of Cimar are made of massive wooden slats pressed
together and held with riveted iron bands.  They have been age-worn to a
smooth finish, and look to be heavy enough to hold off a small army once
someone manages to close them.  The sides of the gates which face High Cimar
are unadorned, and since they remain perpetually open, it is unconcernedly so
that they are not decorative.  The sides which face the palace's interior,
however, are inlaid with a patchwork of gold and ivory, obsidian, and a few
jewels toward the center;  all thrown together into a breathtaking likeness
of a mighty boar, the symbol of Cimar's power.  To the east, High Cimar's
glittering streets and bright green groves stand high above the rest of the
city.

The Temple of High Cimar~
In high gothic style architecture, this layered room stands forty feet
into the sky at its apex.  Staring up to the uppermost point of the
cavernous vaulted ceiling, you can't quite be sure how steep the sides are.
It could be nearly flat, or it could stretch on up for a mile - your depth
perception is severely skewed by your perspective.  You notice a modest
wooden stairwell leading up one corner of the chamber, first past the huge
columns on the bottom level, then stretching on beyond the smaller columns
above that, and finally passing the ornate frescoes and stained glass
windows at the top level.  It leads to a small balcony at the very top of
the room, where a few priests seem to be congregating.  Several pulpits are
set up in this room;  one from which to preach each sort of religion, one
might assume.

join the ceiling high above.  And the ceiling... the massive vaulted style

The Paladin's Abode~
Orderly, virtuous and dedicated, the average paladin and his personality
are accurately reflected in Cimar's paladin guild.  A member of the chapter
might have a seat at a plain wooden table next to a clear pane glass
window, eating a bowl of hot soup or a helping of fish caught in the red
sea to the south.  He might look out that same window to the streets of
High Cimar, to watch for wrongdoings or evil, or simply to contemplate the
blessing of life as evident in the moving, working, living city below.  A
rack of gleaming shields, armor, swords, and maces seems to be the only
thing in this place not made of simple wooden slats and poles.

The Sojourn~
All around this room, candles of various colors exude various odors and
burn at various lengths.  Puddles of wax coat every shelf.  Each religious
zealot who comes through this guildhall lights a candle in some symbolic
showing or another, and each of them believes deeply that it is a great
gesture in worship of his or her god of choice.  To be blessed for the
coming days would be a great thing, and every highly religious priest in
this guild knows the importance of having a god on his side.  Symbols have
been drawn all over the flat surfaces of the room, culminating in a huge
pentagram which takes up nearly all the floor space.  Vicious weapons and
elaborately decorated armor dangle from hooks and pegs everywhere, and
droplets of the blood of the sacreligious and heretical prove to be the
only thing marring any of it.

The Upper Monastery~
Almost like a bell tower, this balcony area resides in the huge vaulted
ceiling of the main chamber of High Cimar's temple.  Looking over the
railed edge, you stare down a significant distance to the ground floor of
the cathedral.  Peering at the rows of pews and gothic columns from this
vantage point, you are struck by not only their beauty, but also by their
stately order.  This upper level balcony is constructed of modest wooden
beams which creak when trodden upon, yet seem perfectly solid, being
anchored to the granite walls of the temple.  Up this high, the light from
the stained glass windows below provides a surreal glow of colored warmth
from underneath your feet.

The Cloister~
A quiet, reflective place, this guild is where Cimar's healers come to
pay homage to their lords and ladies, and to contemplate the happenings of
the day.  Gorgeous wood panels, varnished and kept shining in the low
lamplight, adorn each wall.  The ceiling, an awe-inspiring vaulted affair
featuring an intricately painted rendition of the Shalaran star chart
which some priests use to locate their source of power, is an imposing and
impressive sight.  All manner of chairs are scattered about the room, from
large, comfortable divans to flat straw mats on the dusty floor.  This
place is very quiet, like most of the rest of the temple of High Cimar, and
you sense that to disturb such a thing would be as sacreligious as an anti-
paladin's presence.

The Cimar Library~
You stand in the midst of the incredible library of Cimar, whose renown
far precedes it.  It is said that this very room contains every book written
in Shalar since the Great War, and no small number of those volumes which were
written before it.  It is a quiet place, and scholarly people sit and study in
almost complete silence;  the only noise you can make out here is from outside
the temple of High Cimar.  Some of the sounds from Cimar's business district
waft up this high, and the singing masts of the city's harbor are barely
audible, yet add a distinct color to the overall sonority in the air.  Turning
your full attention back to the books by which you are surrounded, you see a
series of massive bookshelves directly before you and to each side.

E second age~
-=[ The Second Age ]=-

The Others had gone to whatever land they left, through whatever
gods-forsaken rift they used to reach Shalar.  They had gone, strangely,
leaving no trace.  Theories abound as to their departure, but the most
popular is given again by General Tinctoris ('Surviosron'):

One can only speculate ... that the god, that shaft of
blazing darkness, which came to combat the lords of Shalar,
was forced to retreat, bundling up his Others with him.
Sound defeat rings through the air, though our champions
have also left the field of battle...

Thousands of years have passed since this time.  And, as I have mentioned,
Shalarans today wallow in the most despicable of self-inflictions:
ignorance.  It is my hope - my task - to assure the land a chance of
survival, for certain prophecies were once made:

The year of the fang shall mark the second coming of
their bulwark;  Dur is his name, and upon his countenance
is the death of worlds.

-Boethius the Mad
'Desaevio' c. 12 SB

...and while Boethius may have indeed been a madman, the last 1500 years
have brought nothing but truth from his words.  How can the Great War and
the Others, and their god Dur, have descended into mythos?  How is it that
so few have speculated upon whence they came, and whether they will return?
Keep in mind, children (which I call you for your habits and memory), the
weight of the Great War:  we are a great land which was laid waste in a
matter of days or weeks, which is rebuilding slowly and which cannot
withstand another such invasion.  Should the words of Boethius and numerous
other prophets come to pass, shall we be forced to hide helplessly once
more?  The gods have not forgotten;  be assured, they remember well, for
they have existed since that time.  Take heed of their actions and their
will, for they prepare Shalar for war!

There is little else for me to tell you.

-Otho Sostenc II
~
E price~
-=[ The Price ]=-

Many of Shalar's Asgaardian lords and nearly all its mortal men were lost
during the next thirty six hours of battle.  The more fragile element,
those from whom we Shalarans have descended, burrowed their way beneath the
ground to avoid extinction, or were simply made extinct.  Eight in ten died
that day, and those who survived could tell nothing of the battle which
raged above save for the hellish shrieks and explosive sounds of impact
which resonated through even the deepest of corridors.  Mortal Shalar lived
this period in terror, oblivious to their own fate as the battle which
would determine it dragged toward a conclusion without their aid.  When the
men and women who burrowed to survive limped their way to the surface, they
knew not what would await them.  What they found was a cataclysm.

The sky burns with incarnadine fire, and the rivers and
oceans run as pure blood.  Corpses defiled and broken lay
strewn about the earth as numerous as the stars in the
ruddy sky, and mountains beat to piles of rubble.  Even
the walls of Kost have evaporated almost without trace...

-Tinctoris de Krumn
'Surviosron' c. 1 SB

(On the next page, you see the chapter called, "The Second Age.")
~
E armageddon~
-=[ Armageddon ]=-

The Great War, which had already reached a fevered pitch, rose in grand and
horrible crescendo to the point where all of Shalar was oppressed by the
din of combat.  The gods, in their righteous anger, struck out at the
Others, felling them with the same ease with which Shalar's assailants had
raped the land only days before.  In the process, however, they found that
because of the Others' mysterious nature, they had to use dangerous methods
in wiping them from existence as quickly as possible.  Inevitably, tendrils
of violently lashing power took an innocent Shalaran's life or a forest's
well-being in seeking the soul of an Other soldier.  The gods found that
they had reached an unfortunate quandary:  the destruction of the planet
from which they were attempting to excise the cancerous invading force had
been necessitated in order to do any good at all.  And while this grievous
damage was being wrought in the name of Shalar's freedom, what was
certainly the most malevolent threat of the Great War made its appearance.

Then there rose a veritable horizon of impenetrable shadow,
crowned with lightning and ice, filling all the sky.
It reared its enormous shape above the world,
and stretched toward the Shalaran lords a single hand...

-Jor Takin'ln
'Winter of the World' c. 19 SB

A battle cry was sounded once more as the god of the Others thrust his way
through the rift, and the invaders renewed their efforts.  Truly, this was
the darkest hour of the Great War, for even the pantheon felt its advantage
begin to crumble.

(You turn another page to see the words, "The Price.")
~
E intervention~
-=[ The Intervention ]=-

Not a soul in Shalar knew where these otherworldly raiders had come from,
and thus they were simply dubbed by the common folk as the "Others."  Word
of their appearance in the lands and descriptions of the horrors they'd
wrought thus far preceded them by mere hours;  such was the vicious and
terrifying speed with which they devastated the countryside.  As an added
menace, the Others' destruction was not foisted solely upon mortal
Shalar... by virtue of their mere presence in the world, the land began to
die.  Vast forests of the rotting, rancid flesh of trees embedded in cold,
dry, lifeless soil and the stench of the decomposing flora and fauna of the
sea eventually attracted the attention of even the gods.

'The heavens see their error, and they come!  But alas!
We have fallen.'

-Blackeye the Weed, Last Defender of Kost
(Upon seeing the fiery descent of the Pantheon from
Asgaard into the heart of the invasion at Kost.)

Realizing that if the Others were allowed free reign in Shalar, then Shalar
would cease to be, the immortal warriors did indeed part the sky and ride
lightning to the ground, wielding blazing weapons of vast, unimaginable
power.  What happened next, however, would indelibly change the shape of
the world despite their kingly efforts.

(The next chapter's title is "Armageddon.")
~
E war~
-=[ The War ]=-

An army struck;  a massive army, the size of a continent, composed of
beings of many races and colors, many sizes and shapes, but all of the same
temperment.  The Great War's finest mortal leader spoke of this multitude
in his enshrined dying words (which are on public display, one might add):

...the horde poured from the sky, they rose from the earth,
they stepped from every tree and rock, from under every
bridge.  Through rents in the air they boiled as if pus
from a festering wound, intending to terrorize Shalar at
every locale, and they did indeed do so...

-Tinctoris de Krumn
'Requiem t'General' c. 9 SB

Other writers of the day tell how the raiders wore a thousand uniforms;
armors and garb never seen in this world before or since.  Every record of
these days includes a description of the raiders which is no less vivid
than the last, and whose details are rarely repetitive.  The one fact which
remains unchanged through all accounts is the sheer brutality and precision
with which this army went about Shalar's dissection...

(Turning another page, you see the title, "The Intervention.")
~
E arrival~
-=[ The Arrival ]=-

Before Shalar had a name, the gods looked down from the heavens, ripe with
the heady might of celestial power, and noted with dispassion the beings
which had inhabited their lands.  Aloof and uninterested in mortal affairs,
these gods lived in a stagnant pool of time and space unaffected by the
outside;  to torture or reward for entertainment and then to fade away was
their sole interaction with the lowly men who infested the soil.

Without care for that which lay below
the gods did prey upon one another
and the skies rain'd fire for their tears
and sulphur for their blood.

-Boethius the Mad
'Desaevio' c. 12 SB

Though the meddlings of the immortal were largely a hindrance to Shalar's
advancement into a civilized day, mankind did manage a glorious age of
prosperity and development far beyond what exists today.  From this period
of paradoxial discord within tranquility emerged new turmoil, however.
With the arrival of the otherworldly host, some say the first golden age
of man came to an ending.

I am Otho the bard, and this is my penning.  Long have the songs of this

into mythos.  A dangerous subject for one's memory to fail, as I will tell
in due time.  Read on, Shalaran, for the prophecies of this world's wisest
men and the deaths of its greatest heroes must not have been in vain.  Read
on, and read closely, for only scholars and fools might refuse that which
is free and yet priceless.

.                            they rejected me as well.
One day, the great white heart shall tumble

shall be thrust

.                               Indeed, for I am the wellspring from which
the tears of the heavens
originate.
And in the terrible beginning of things when the monolithic were
supplanted by their greaters without care for that which lay below the gods
did prey upon one another and the skies rain'd fire for their tears and
sulphur for their blood though we do not realize the extent to which these
things were done in our age of destructive shadow which overcasts the
original sin of the father Yea For I Am Thy Brother And I Know Thee!

.    The one shall be split in twain
.    and the five shall become as one
.    and the day of the jackal
the month of the dog
the year of the fang shall mark the second coming of

is the death of worlds.
And possibly many other, worse things.

You are shocked upon opening this book, as it leaps directly into busy
ravings built upon paranoid delusion.  The print bounds from the top of the

script.  Here and there, tiny copperplate letters adorn a page, explaining
what the editor has done in his attempt to reproduce Boethius' exact
rantings.  There is no title or introduction, so you simply begin to read
where you perceive a beginning, with the words, "And so I came..."
~
E give me peace depart~
"Give me peace..."

Give me peace, O my jarring thoughts.
Is it not enough that Love, Fate, and Death
wage war all about me and at my very gates,
without finding other enemies within?
And you, my heart, are you still as you were?
Disloyal to me alone:  for you harbor fierce spies
and have allied yourself
with my enemies, bold and brisk as they are.
In you Love reveals his secret messages,
in you Fate boasts all her triumphs,
and Death awakens the memory of that blow
which must surely destroy all that remains of me;
In you gentle thoughts arm themselves with falsity:
Wherefore I charge you alone guilty of all my ills.


"I depart."

"I depart."  I said no more, for grief
robbed my heart of life.
Then Clori broke out in tears and said,
with interrupted cries of "Alas":
"Hence I remain in pain.  Ah, may I never
cease to pine away in painful lays."
Dead I was, now I am alive, for my spent spirits
returned to life at the sound of such pitiable accents.

The Rise and Fall of Kost

Once a great walled fortress, O Kost,
do the hills alone remember your gleaming walls
and shimmering marble buttresses?
I suspect that it is so.
Did that army, which came as in the night
through otherworldly veins
destroy you so utterly?
I suspect this, too, is so.
To wage war at your aged gates
as so many had done
was commonplace, and yet you could not withstand.
Now the foothills serve as a reminder of past glory
and as turgid limb to your distended bosom
while you waste away beneath
the tiny light of Cimar:
injustice has no name for your plight, dear Kost.

A fairly busy room, the recruitment area is alive with all different
manner of people.  There are a few aristocratic looking hobnobbers, looking
down their noses at the local recruitment officer for the guild, and a
small group of ruddy-looking folk gathered around him and gazing reverently
at his flowing tan robes.  To these people, the poor and the needy, those
tan robes are a sign of acceptance and safety;  any Common Guild recruiter
is fairly quickly made one of the most popular people in the area.  This
recruiter ignores the buffed warriors and shiningly wealthy merchant-types
who give him no second glance, and kindly focuses his attention on those
who have a definite interest in what he has to say...

High Cimar~
The streets of High Cimar are lined with gold, so the saying goes.  While
they don't appear in person to be made of gold, exactly, they are awfully
expensive-looking.  Cobbled with rare and costly black granite and cemented
by silver dust mortar from the mountains to the north, this road alone must
have cost a fortune.  All around you on this stretch of land are beautifully
maintained groves of trees and flowers, plant life stretching the entire
length of the district.  There are no private homes in High Cimar;  rather,
only the temple - which houses the holy guilds and the Cimarrite library -
and the palace of Cimar itself.  To your south, the city of Cimar reaches its
massive fingers out to the reddish sea, down a gradual slope.  To the west,
the city's palace stands magnificent as the highest point in Cimar.

The epicenter of Shalaran religion, according to some, High Cimar's temple
certainly stands as a gorgeous beacon of a reminder;  Shalar's pantheon will
not be ignored or forgotten any time soon.  Here, to its south, you stand in
the High Temple Square, where you can marvel at the temple's construction.
Flaring out to either side of the building, spidery buttresses fly as if
wings, lifting the temple itself above the rest of the city.  Stained glass
windows stretch up to the clouds, appearing by way of your perspective to
out-heighten even the massive outer walls.  The windows depict glorious
scenes of battle, and multiple heavenly countenances which become more and
more recognizable as the windows deign to near the filthy ground.  Columns
and statues, all carved in an intricate style, lend to the building's art.

A Rubbly Path~
This section of the inner wall was broken down long ago.  As to what might
have done it, you can only speculate.  You can see that, from the way the
wall itself is constructed, as one continuous whole, it would be a very large
job indeed to correct this small gap.  And thus, it's gone a very long time
without being fixed, it seems.  The inner wall certainly isn't as important
to the city as the outer wall;  the massive outer walls could hold off any
force, while the inner walls are more of a landmark from the first days of
Old Cimar.  Everyone from aristocrats to messengers to members of the
royal family uses this sloping "path," as it's been cleared through the
center of all the rubble, and creates a very convenient shortcut from the
palace to Old Cimar and vice versa.  There is no cobble here, and rubble
still lies at the edges of the path.

The Highgate~
Once the titanic outer walls of Cimar were built, the inner wall had far
less strategic significance.  On the 1000th anniversary of the fall of Kost,
the gate here was torn down and replaced with a work of art.  This plot of
land had served as home to Old Cimar's northern gate for hundreds of years,
but when it no longer had a defensive function for the city, great architects
were called from all over the region to design a tribute to the city's
longevity.  This gorgeous and elegant arching tower of ivory was the result.
So much like lace, it seems as though it should not capable of supporting
itself as a free-standing structure;  yet, it has stood centuries more since
its construction.  To the south, it's a short walk along Toller Road to Kost
Square, and to the north it is only a few dozen feet to the temple of High
Cimar.

The Great Northern Gate~
The gargantuan double-peaked gate at the northern end of Cimar is a larger
and less elaborate version of the Highgate, put in place to instill a sense of
awe in approaching travellers, yet still functional as a defensive
emplacement.  The huge gates themselves tower over every building in High
Cimar.  It takes a team of horses to haul them open and shut during a battle.
In the last few hundred years, there have been fewer and fewer armies to
attempt to siege Cimar;  the gates have settled into their place in the open
position.  All around you, the beauty of Cimar is stunning and overwhelming.
This entire section of the city is built upon the foothills of Mount Cim to
the west, and is elevated above the rest.  You look down on everything in
Cimar from here, and it seems like a beautiful place.

The High Wood~
Groves of beautifully maintained trees line the section of this city
known as High Cimar.  As this corner of the city climbs slowly up the
foothills of Mount Cim, it rises into the sky toward the peak of the
mountain and away from the salty air of the ocean to the south.  Trees
flourish here, healthy and strong, and the correct shade of green.  Far
from the pollution of the decrepit sections of the city, regal High Cimar
is awash in cleanliness, decency, and beauty which is rivaled in few other
cities.  To the west, High Avenue streaks out the north gate, and a ways to
the south, Toller Road drives its way east and west.  Off to the west, you
see the temple of High Cimar, and beyond that Cimar's palace at the city's
highest point.

Gorgeous multicolored marble tiles cover the walls and floor of this
building, and the ceiling is a huge black slate slab.  To one side, you see
off-white marble with gold veins of color, and below you you see black with
ghostly gray stripes.  A desk stretches across the length of the room, an
obsidian top perched upon a stand of gold-flecked bricks.  This is where the
riches of Cimar reside;  the bank of the largest city on the continent.  Just
below the black-as-pitch tabletop, you see a sign detailing the banking
process.  Through an open door to the south, you see the traffic of West
Toller Road bustling by.  Given the highly public placement of this building,
it would be a reasonable assumption that your money will be safe here.

An Auction Stand~
A large wooden podium atop a grandstand looms quietly here, at the north end
of Kost Square.  This area is reserved for auctions, and thus traffic is a bit
less daunting.  It is considered rude to pass through an auction in progress
on your way from place to place.  Strewn around the auction grounds are small
pieces of paper;  each has printed upon it a price, a number, a secret
communique from bidder to bidder, a list of items, some sort of auction-
related tidbit of information.  Apparently the grounds haven't been cleaned
since the last auction.  A wind blows through, and momentarily a blizzard of
varicolored papers swirls about you in a blinding whirlwind.

West Toller Road~
The main street in Cimar, Toller Road runs its entire width from east to
west.  The road is narrower here than in the eastern half of the city, as
most traffic moves through the north and east gates.  But you still find
yourself surrounded by a large number of citygoers, from businessmen and
merchants to fairly obvious thieves and purse snatchers.  While there isn't
much traffic moving directly through the city here, there is quite a lot
between the business district in Cimar's southwest quadrant and other parts
of the city.  This part of Toller Road is in Old Cimar, running parallel with
the inner wall to the north.  Lined on both sides by private homes and
branched from by several north-to-south avenues, it bustles with activity
through most of the day.  To the north stands the Bank of Cimar.

You stand at the western edge of Kost Square - the location which most
would say is the center of Cimar both geographically and commercially.
All around you, people hustle back and forth with goods.  Chickens and
geese seem to roam freely here, while most larger livestock you see are
on tethers of some sort.  Most.  Kost Square is certainly Cimar's
busiest point, and there is little way for anyone to dispute that
claim.  This square has taken such a firm hold on Cimar that any roads
which run through it become nameless and meaningless.  The traffic goes
through however it can, running side to side and looping around carts
and kiosks in such a manner that much of what comes into Kost Square
doesn't leave in the correct direction for a very long time.  At the
center of the area, a strange black monolith towers.

An Intersection~
This is quite possibly the most convoluted intersection of roads in
Cimar.  It is at the northeastern corner of Kost Square, which is a
complicated place on its own, and three major roads intersect here.
Running in from the east, Toller Road blunders straight into a small
fence, and half of it shears off to continue into the western section of
Cimar.  From the south, Wormwood Avenue tangles its way through Old Cimar
and finally flares into nonexistence at an indeterminate point somewhere
near here, with one last twist through and around the square.  And,
thrusting out from the chaos off to the north, a perfectly straight and
beautifully maintained road is born into High Cimar and moves directly
out the north gate as though disgusted by its confused peers.

and less restrained.  Suddenly, it becomes blatantly obvious:  this is Cimar's
assassin guild.  The ultimate assassin guild, in fact, for it has no set base
of operations and no one guildmaster.  Looking around, you see half a dozen
men staring at you.  Any one of them might be ready to train you in the finer

walls, and guarded by burly men being paid to be present, this area serves as
the thief's guild of Cimar.  You see many grand master thieves lurking about,
training the younger, inexperienced pickpockets;  watching the students dash
out into the crowded square to the north to weave their way in and out of the
throng of citizens and return with a sack full of loot, the guildmaster
remains innocent while his reputation as a teacher grows, along with the gold
in his pockets.

confusion of a mangled intersection to the north and the busy commerce
of Kost Square to the west.  In that area, roads have no names... there
is merely a large amorphous shape done in streets from which sprout
individuals which then take on identity.  Wormwood Avenue is one such
road.  It curves and winds, bends and in some cases even spins through
the inner city, visiting guilds and shops, homes and landmarks.  From
here, you can see the Talis River to your east, over a dam of some
sort.  To the north, Toller Road makes ready to smash into Kost Square.

spins through the inner city, visiting guilds and shops, homes and
landmarks.  From here, you can see the Talis River to your east, over a dam
of some sort.  A little ways to the north and west, Kost Square's darker
corners bustle quietly with all manner of black market items and shady
characters making unpalatable bargains.  Directly to your east and south,
you can continue to walk around the square along the meandering avenue.

West Rantid Road~
This street was once called Main Street by the original Cimarrite
settlers, and runs through the heart of Old Cimar.  Since the city has
expanded, and since the advent of highways and trade routes, Rantid Road
has fallen into a state of relative disuse.  Compared with the incredible
traffic of Toller Road, this street is calm and picturesque.  The
cobblestones making up the road are worn and cracked at the edges, and make
a uniform surface of smoothed stone.  In the center, the cobblestones have
come entirely away in many places, revealing occasional glimpses at the
ancient slate pathways which preceded even Old Cimar.  Rantid Road
continues to the east, across the South Bridge and away from the center of
Old Cimar.  The expansive road lies both west and south of you, and a road

The End of Rantid Road~
Here, Rantid Road meets an unceremonious end.  This was once the main road
of Cimar, during the days of the original settlers, and helped to found a
great city on the rubble that was Kost.  It appears as though the road once
led through the inner wall here, and out into the west;  since the city's
expansion, however, the wall has been sealed here, and the road simply ends.
The inner wall of Cimar, seen up close, is impressive -- yet, being a wall
which is more than a millenium old, it shows its age.  Worn by weather, by
ancient battles, by sun and by mischief, it stands as if a tooth which, while
once a great fang, has been worn to dull uselessness.  To the north, a space
between the wall and a home opens out as the wall has broken down there;  to
the east, the road continues across Old Cimar.

A Modest Home~
Given some of the other magnificent and beautiful houses in Old Cimar, this
one seems a bit out of place.  It stands directly next to a small core of
untouched land at the center of the city;  a tightly-packed cluster of
ancient trees, a small pond, a few worn old pathways, and this dwelling.
Made of simple stone and wood, it looks to have withstood the tests of time
rather well, perhaps because of the shelter of the grove of trees nearby.  A
rocking chair stands in one corner away from the door, next to a large brick
fireplace.  A table is at the other end of the room, with a wooden bowl and
spoon set out for a meal;  scents of cooking waft in from the eastern door.
A thick canvas apron and a large wood axe hang on pegs near the door to the
north, which leads back out to Rantid Road.

An oven made of stones, a table of gnarled wood, and utensils carved out of
sticks and bones, everything in this kitchen has come from nature.  None of
Cimar's modern developments have gone into making this home, and no cast iron
or other technology have created its components.  The oven burns hot, as its
slate hatch holds the smoke in, and something which was likely caught earlier
in the day is prepared with a hickory scent cooked into it.  A small door to
the north holds breezes outside and the heat of the kitchen in, and windows
to the east and south look out on the streets and trees of Old Cimar.  An
open doorway to the west leads back into the main room of this quaint and
modest home.

A Large Home~
It's not obvious whose home this is, but so near to the center of Old
Cimar, it must be that of a rather important person.  It's a beautiful home,
and wooden beams and log construction all around compose every wall of the
residence.  The location would lead one to believe that this was one of the
first homes in the original settlement of Cimar, and yet it would have to be
nearly 1500 years old for that to be true.  If it's the case, then the wooden
framework construction must have been renewed several times.  It certainly
doesn't look like wood that's been there for one and a half millennia.  To
the south, a large door leads out to West Rantid Road, while to the east and

scent of pine needles.  Also on the table lies an open book, bound with soft
leather and printed upon yellowed parchment with a handsome script.  There is
a large bear skin covering the floor at the foot of the bed, and the solid
oak archway to the west leads to the main room of the home.  Through a window

The Captain's Residence~
This lavish home is where the captain of the Cimar Cityguard Corps resides
when not on duty.  Which, were you to ask most people, is not very often.  It
is a lush compartment indeed, furnished with the finest woods, cut out of the
forests to the north and lacquered in the cities to the east.  An elaborately
patterned rug covers the floor with a brilliant depiction of some ancient
ceremony.  It seems, in fact, to be a rather old and likely very valuable
rug;  the captain walks on it daily, however, with no regard for history or
art.  It's easy to grow to despise the man, looking around his home.  All
manner of artifacts adorn glass shelves around the room, from clay pots to
unidentifiable objects of some archaic origin or another.  The door by which

A Grand Hall~
One of the most extravagant homes in Cimar is this, the cityguard captain's
abode.  Sometimes referred to as the old man's "base of operations," the
truth of the matter is that he doesn't leave its confines very often, outside
his daily rounds.  A high vaulted ceiling cries out to be appreciated, and a
beautiful pegged wooden floor has been varnished to a mirror-like sheen.
Perfectly clear large glass windows are positioned all around the hall, and
the room basks in glorious sunlight for most of the day.  That light is
refracted and reflected through the home by the nearly-mirrored floor, and by
crystalline fixtures the captain ordered in from overseas, and then had
placed strategically where a visitor's eyes would most likely be drawn to
them.

merchants to fairly obvious thieves and purse snatchers.  While there isn't
much traffic moving directly through the city here, there is quite a lot
between the business district in Cimar's southwest quadrant and other parts
of the city.  This part of Toller Road is in Old Cimar, running parallel with
the inner wall to the north.  Lined on both sides by private homes and
branched from by several north-to-south avenues, it bustles with activity
through most of the day.  North from here, a small path moves through a hole
in the inner wall toward High Cimar.

The Western Arch~
The massive stone walls of Cimar open here, forming an archway through
which its inhabitants and visitors pass when entering or leaving.  Gates
which look as though they would take a small dragon to tow open and shut
stretch forty feet over your head.  The traffic here has worn the
cobblestones under your feet to a smooth surface, almost flat and nearly
shining, reminiscent of dulled and unpolished marble.  Several of the city's
complacent Watchmen lounge at the edges of this massive contour, glaring at
passing members of the Cimarrite Army.  The street stretches off to the east,
and becomes a mountain route leading into the west.  Broker Avenue stretches
off to the south through the bustling business district of Cimar, while
Mount Cim dominates the entire setting from the sky to the northwest.

A Small Kiosk~
The atmosphere of a bazaar permeates this small structure, open both to
the north and the south.  A tall wooden lance stands upright at the center
of the pavillion, holding a tent away from the ground.  The corners of that
thick canvas sheet are tamped to the soft dirt of this area, and more wooden
struts about half the length of the center strut support each edge of the
fabric square to the east and west.  A metal arch holds the north and south
edges up into doorway-like openings.  The air moves freely through this
shop; it is the only temporary building in the neighborhood, and stands out
in a strange way.  The smells of a dozen different varieties of food fill
the breeze, and travel up and down Toller Road to the north, luring in
customers like a fisherman's line.

Behind the Wall~
This strange space is created by a hole in the inner wall of Cimar.  Were
it not for this hole, there would not be enough room between the residence to
the east and the wall itself for anything larger than an imp;  as it stands,
this is a viable option for passage between Rantid Road to the south, Toller
Road to the north, and the business district to the west.  Whether the
residents of the home to your east appreciate the trespassing this convenient
route causes isn't able to be determined at the moment.  From the amount of
wear on the ground, however, it's apparent that not many people care.

The Smithy's Cache~
The sound of ringing metal fills the air in this armory;  the finest armors
in Cimar come from the forge here, in the Smithy's Cache.  The room is well-
lit, owing mostly to large holes in the ceiling covered by what seems to be an
incredible variety of almost-transparent metal.  Another strange type of metal
is set into a lamp-like structure against one wall;  as it slowly burns -- as
if that weren't remarkable enough -- it sheds the light of the sun,
necessitating a shield so as not to blind customers.  Truly, marvels such as
this one might never have expected to see from a mere metal worker.  Perhaps
the man who works here sidelights as an alchemist.

The Warrior's Storehouse~
Every inch of this shop looks as though it could kill a man.  The walls
bristle with armaments, claymores and crossbows dangle from hooks on the
ceiling, and all varieties of traded-in weapons are piled on the floor in
places.  Rough customers come through, but from the looks of the men behind
the counter to the south, fighting inside is fairly easily discouraged.  To
the north, a doorway leads back out into the business district of Cimar.  The
pungent smell of a burning forge wafts through the air, and the sharp hiss of
hot metal being cooled in a bucket of river water slices its way to your ears
occasionally.  Some weapons gleam as if made of polished silver while others
are dull as a day with a family of halflings, but all are as lethal as a
devil's tooth.

straight into the harbor.  Forming the western border of Cimar's business
district, Broker Avenue is named for the activity which takes place in the
many widely varying shops and stores along its considerable length:
negotiating, bargaining, and haggling.  In the shade for most of the day,
between the high-roofed places of business to the east and the towering
wall to the west, the street's cobblestones are not blanched pasty grayish-
white as they are elsewhere in the city.  At the center of the path, they
are worn down by traffic, but at the edges, they retain a sort of healthy
shade and shine as though new.

The Business District~
The busiest sector of Cimar -- and perhaps in this region of Shalar -- the
business district's buzz of activity is audible from anywhere in the city.
Prices screamed by full-lunged shopkeepers and offers made at a shout ring
through the streets and bounce from Cimar's massive outer wall to the west.

District Alley~
Between the shops of the business district and the inner wall of Cimar, a
narrow space runs along most of the border between the old city and the
District.  As you walk here, you see and hear and smell evidence of each
shop's wares;  this alleyway runs behind most of the stores in the area, and
quite a lot of trash has been thrown here and left to rot.  A loaf of bread
here, a lump of ruined mithril there, the items nobody sees in their shopping
make their way here.  A perfectly viable route from the north side of the
District to the south side, you can see why the alley gets as little traffic
as it does, despite its convenience.  You pick your way carefully through the
sludge on the ground by the light provided from the narrow slit between the
edges of the roofs and the wall up above.  A small shop lies to the west.

The Redwater Tap~
This is the most desirable location in all of Cimar at which to own a
building.  It lies at the southernmost tip of the business district, where
the greatest traffic comes through the city, and in full view of the
beautiful harbor and sea to the south... and the lucky owners of the Redwater
Tap have obtained it for their bar.  All manner of people are seated around
this establishment at high tables surrounded with plush stools.  The walls
are decorated with paintings, clocks, and bits and pieces of maritime
artifacts such as anchors, block, and lines.  There's even a huge headpiece
over the bar itself, depicting a topless mermaid.  And at the south end of
the bar, opposite the doorway, a huge window -- which likely cost a fortune
-- looks out for a gorgeous view of the crimson ocean.

A fool once asked his master how to speak.  The master said, "Speak not, for

some other means.  The master said, "You must listen, fool."  Last, the fool
asked how to listen.  The master sighed and said, "If you don't know how to

General Store~
This is perhaps the least phenomenal of the shops in Cimar's business
district.  With walls made of simple wooden boards and a floor of dusty
stone, the shop functions perfectly well without much fanfare or frilliness.
This is where the denizens of this great city come -- be they mere peasants
or members of the highest order of aristocrats -- when they need the simplest
of supplies.  Many think of such a store as a great equalizer, though the
uppity folk who are forced to come from their mansions to shop consider its
relatively boring appearance to be more of a slap in the face than anything
else.  To the north, you may exit back to the business district, while the

The Kraken Army~
This room is made up to look like an army bunker, very similar to those at
the eastern end of Cimar.  Rows of cots and shelves line each wall, and
members of the Kraken Army mill about unprofessionally.  Mercenaries for hire,
this "army" shows its true colors by appearing simply as a group of uneducated
ruffians.  A few books lie strewn about, along with diagrams of various
races' anatomies, and practice dummies line the back wall, to the west.  A
crumpling desk near the doorway has a tiny cracked brass bell sitting on its
edge, upon which a customer looking to hire a street tough might presumably
ring to receive service.  This back-alley organization has all the spit and
polish of a band of orcs, yet enough brawn that hiring a member is a viable
option.  To the east, a darkened alleyway lurks.

The Wizard's Wynd~
The walls of this shop have been painted in such a manner so as to make it
seem as though it stretches on out of sight to some point in infinity
directly behind the counter.  The actual result is a rather ridiculous effect
which suggests that a child might have been able to design something better;
at the very least, it's done in a relatively attractive shade of blue.  Racks
and shelves all around the shop are covered with stacks of wands and
grimoires, scrolls and seals, canes and staves.  To the west, a door leads out
to Broker Avenue.  At the east end of the room, behind the shop's table of
business, bits of lifeless wood and scraps of paper pile up waiting to be

The Apothecary~
Upon entering this shop, the sense of smell is the first to be assaulted;
hundreds of different herbs and chemicals spout their pungent odors into the
air, and nothing keeps them from their apparent business of multiplying and
becoming all the more offensive.  At a counter to the east, miniature shelves
hold tiny bottles filled with liquids of dozens of unique shades.  Large
boards mounted horizontally against the walls serve as shelves for the
ingredients of many of these potions:  roots, herbs, crumbling rocks of
unidentifiable minerals, and bits of dried animal.  To the west, a small door
is covered with a large blanket;  it holds in the scents to keep the shop
fresh, no doubt.

straight to the harbor below.  This loop of road extends the business

Moving down the side of the cliff at the southern end of town, a large

Bolted together with steel ties and lashed to the crimson-stained rock of the
cliff, it holds steady through all weather.  Below, the wooden docks are
likewise mounted to the sea's floor and the cliff's side, stretching out
into the reddish water of the harbor.  At the moorings along the docks, many
varieties of ships are tied up;  fishing schooners, royal ships, military
vessels, all are visible from here.  Above you, the outer wall of Cimar opens
for several yards in both directions to allow traffic down to the harbor, and

in support of the walkway.  They are banded several inches from the top by
iron to prevent decay, but the exposed wood is very splintered.  Dry rot has

Certainly a beautiful ship, this vessel seems to have come a long way,
judging by the fact that ships like it simply do not come from anywhere near
Cimar.  Huge gilded winglike structures protrude from each side of the craft,
their tips dipping gently into the water's surface.  On the bow of the ship,
the wooden bust of a maiden perches.  Not just any maiden, the lady depicted
upon this ornament has stylized elvish ears, far longer and more pointed than
a real elf's, and delicately feathered wings which stretch back along the
sides of the ship.  You cannot tell what these decorative structures have been
made of... wood would be a safe assumption, but nothing on the ship shows any
signs of wear.  Even the deck of this yacht is spotless and new.  Suddenly,
with a start, you realize that the ship has no mast, and no sails.

A Fishing Ship~
Huge nets strung up above you drip foul-smelling water down onto the deck
where you stand.  The entire vessel reeks of fish, though the brackish water
of the bilges and the dozens of barrels of chum gladly contribute their odors
to the stench as well.  A mop and bucket stand to the side, near the rail, but
only as a token gesture;  the ground is covered with fish guts, heads,
eyeballs, tails, fins, gills, and several bits which seem not to have come
from fish at all.  The whole ship creaks and whines in protest as the waves
tip it back and forth, but miraculously, it remains whole.  A mooring rope as
thick as a human's arm has been draped around a piling on the bow of the ship,
and its newness clashes with everything else on board.

A Large Vessel~
Easily the largest ship on the docks at the moment, this vessel's main mast
reaches above the thirty foot high cliff to the north and pokes a good way
into visibility from the streets of the city up above.  Sixty feet from stem
to stern, its purpose isn't clear, but its excellent construction and massive
size lead you to believe it is of military or some other official origins.
The ship is obviously quite old, as the floorboards have a significant amount
of grime packed between them, and the corners of the deck are far from
spotless.  However, it is in a very good state of repair.  The rigging is
brand new, no frayed rope or splintered wood has been allowed to go
unreplaced.  It sways almost imperceptibly in the waves of the harbor, its
sheer size stabilizing it nicely.

The Red Harbor~
The crimson cliffside to the north, thrust up by the earth and scorched
with its hue by the hand of the gods, has surely taken a hand in coloring
this water.  All around you, swirling currents and breaking waves all take on
a perverse bloodlike hue.  To the west, boats toss up and down in the swells
of the sea while moored to the docks of Cimar, and to the south, the small
inlet at which the Talis River meets the sea opens up into a huge ocean.  You
see a few boats paddling and sailing about here, near the shore, but their
numbers thin considerably as you peer out to sea.  Looking down, you find
that you cannot see far enough into the ruddy red water even to tell how far
you're seeing.

The Main Chamber~
A strange room indeed.  Some unseen light source allows you to see that
the walls, ceiling and floor are of the purest white marble, perfectly flat
and featureless.  A single comfortable-looking chair adorns the room,
placed directly in the center.  It beckons to you silently, and you can
almost hear its unspoken command to sit.  Tearing your eyes away from its
ashen contours, its sleek black arms and base, you turn around to find that
the exit behind you has disappeared completely.  In its place is a tiny
brass plate, bolted in place and inscribed upon in very tiny print.

The Royal Bedchamber~
Amazingly, this bed chamber is more elaborately and intricately decorated
than the main body of the palace.  Interior to the building, and indeed,
interior to the foothills the building is embedded in, it has no windows and
no natural light.  It would be quite possible to sleep for days without
realizing the sun has come and gone in such a room as this.  A chandelier
hangs overhead with softly flickering candles, dripping tiny puddles of wax
into gold-plated dishes beneath each light.  The gilding covering nearly
everything in this room reflects the orange light and creates the impression
of being inside a gold nugget.

as far as you can see.  South of here, it turns west out of sight along the
cliff at the edge of the ocean.  Towering above you, the top of the wall is
a dizzying sight.  Through the gate to the west, you see the inside of the
