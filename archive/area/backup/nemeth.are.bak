a seagull~
A seagull is here, floating on the wind.

This gulls's plumage is a mottled grey, with white accents about its
throat.  Its wingspan is nearly twice the length of its body, allowing it to
soar on the strong sea breeze confidently and gracefully.

Some Rocky Cliffs by the Sea~
Rocky cliffs, hewn of light tan sandstone endure the constant pounding of
the surf here.  Sparse scrub grows right up to the lips of the cliffs,
hanging thin tendrils and stalks fifty feet above the turbulent waters
below.  The occasional seabird circling above voices a plaintive cry in the
wind, and occasionally you can see one dive into the water, and rise back to
the sky, its beak laden with a struggling fish.  Far to the north you can
see the majestic white walls of Cimar rising from the plains.  A thin forest
begins to overtake the scrub to the east.

Some Sand Stone Cliffs By The Sea~
Fifty feet below you the sea rages against the sand stone cliffs, which
begin to slope gently down to the southeast.  The forest reaches out slender
fingers to the edge of the cliffs here, with some small saplings' roots
poking out through the stone, and some how taking hold despite the heavy
wind that blows from the sea.  A salty tang assails your nose when ever a
wave pounds below, breaking so heavily that a fine mist reaches you even
this high above.  The cliffs continue to the north and southeast.

On Some Cliffs~
The cliffs are lower here than they are to the north, and the rock that
they are cut from seems a bit darker.  The sea pounds out a restless beat
below you, and the sea spray prevents any plant life beyond a few scraggly
looking strands of scrub to grow here.  An old log, whitened by the sun and
wind and rain is half buried here, the other end sticking precariously out
over the ocean.

Rocky cliffs, hewn of tan sandstone endure the constant pounding of the
surf here.  Sparse scrub grows right up to the lips of the cliffs, hanging
thin tendrils and stalks fifty feet above the turbulent waters below.  Sea
birds float out over the ocean, and the scraggly bushes at your feet
occasionally rustle with the movement of some small animal.

Here, the cliffs come to a point in a single massive chunk of sandstone. 
The stone was carved to look like a man's head, about thirty feet tall.  The
face points to the southwest, and you are standing above its right ear. 
Though the face's features are still discernable, eons of wear and tear by
the harsh wind and sea spray have taken their toll, and the once majestic

In the Mouth of a Giant Sandstone Face~
You are standing in the mouth of a huge face carved into a sheer
sandstone cliff.  The floor of the cavern is rough hewn sandstone, and there
are some small shelves carved onto the walls.  Looking out over the ocean,
you gaze past the face's teeth, which are well rounded from the strong,
constant wind which blows inward.  Obvious care and effort were taken in the
making of this relic, but its magesty is has been tarnished by the ravages
of time.  A rather thick layer of crusted salt covers everything, brought in
by the heavy seay below.  Through this crust, some writing is barely
noticable on the wall.  It might be possible to climb up and out of here,
though it looks perilous.
