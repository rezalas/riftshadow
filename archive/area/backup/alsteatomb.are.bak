a winged child-spirit~
A strange child flutters around on gigantic butterfly wings!

This child is covered in many layers of clothes and a cloak, making it
impossible to see its face or gender.  Gigantic wings have torn through the
clothes, and they flap wildly to keep it in the air.

A Decaying Study~
Obviously inhabited by someone or something, this chamber is immediately
before a tomb.  Splotches of melted wax can be seen on most everything here.
Wet and smelling strongly of mildew, an old yet fancy carpet covers the cold
granite floor.  An ornate mahogany desk and a matching chair are set up
toward the northern wall, some strange implements and books strewn across
the desk's surface.  One book is opened, though it seems to be in very poor
condition.  A rectangular doorway leads to the west, and an inscription is
visible above it.

E book~
Much of the book is rotted, wet and smeared.  Short passages have somehow
remained legible, despite the poor conditions it has been kept in.  
 
Ah, the horrors of existence... to be given the consciousness to learn,
love and examine the nature of death.  Love, most of all, is both the most
horrid curse and generous gift given to us by our creators.  The thought of
the sweet breath of my dearest Alstea to once more caress my cheek brings me
both ecstacy and agony, for though I look back upon better days, I know that
what comes will never be able to compare.  I have sealed my own fate, it
seems.  Never again will my love's eyes rest in mine, her soft lips part to
smile for me or her hands hold my own.  Alone, I must be, until the end
comes.  Ah, the end... Should she have stolen half of her beauty away with
her to the Fields of Paradise, it would be more than enough to sustain me
for the rest of eternity.
 
The handwriting suddenly becomes much, much worse after this paragraph,
making even the intact portions of the book completely unreadable.
