mouth magic~
a magic mouth~
A small human mouth floats in mid-water here, grinning mischievously.
~
A small mouth, completely separated from the rest of its body somehow, floats
in mid-water, grinning at you.  You can tell almost from the start that this
disembodied mouth is actually magical.  Wherever you walk you cannot seem to
see the back side of it, although it does not seem to turn as you float around
to get a better look.  The teeth of the mouth are pure white and look to be
the quality of a nobleman's.  The lips of the mouth do not seem to be in the
shape of a male or female, but rather seem to be somewhere in between.  The
magical mouth continues to grin at you but every once and awhile it seems to
mouth a few words.  When you try to touch the small mouth your hand passes
right through it, as if it is an illusion.

titanium golem~
a titanium golem~
A titanium golem is here, protecting the ruined gates.
~
A huge, towering golem stands here standing completely motionless.  It seems to
be completely made of titanium and is in perfect condition even for all the
time it must have been underwater.  As you examine it further you wonder who
could have made such an intricate piece of work.  Looking at its stern face,
arms and legs made completely from titanium you have no doubt that this golem
fought well in defense of its city.  The golem is made very detailed and if it
weren't for the fact that it did not breath or blink, you would think that you
were looking at a real person.  Upon its chest there is a large "K" emblazoned
with motes of diamond embedded into it.  You can see many other elaborate
carvings on the golem, many that are in the images of merchant ships and
valuable jewels.

golem~
a gold golem~
A golem made completely from gold patrols the streets of the ruined city.
~
A beautifully sculpted golem struts through the watery streets, seemingly
unaware of its surroundings. This golem seems to be a city guard of some type,
for it paces back and forth along the ruined streets.  You gasp as you realize
that the entire golem is made from the purest gold.  The golem's face is set
in an unreadable position and its eyes seem dull and without life.  However,
it continues to pace back and forth, golden sword in hand, looking for any
trouble that might occur.  The golem's forehead is carved with the likeness of
a fist clenching a balance, obviously a sign of law and order.  This golem looks
ready to protect the innocent and punish the corrupt.

an adamantite golem~
A large, stern-looking golem stands here, guarding the temple.
~
An enormous golem made from a strange dark metal stands here, staring into
space.  It has arms as big as tree-trunks and its chest is as wide as a barn
door.  It holds a large hammer at one side and you are sure that your head would
be crushed with one swipe of that mighty weapon.  Judging from this guardian
of the temple, you begin to think that this city took their religion very
seriously to dedicate so much time and effort to this one golem.  It wears a
large breastplate that is decorated with streams of gold, tarnished silver and
various gems.  A large hammer is carved into the golem's forehead and you can
see a moon and sun on either of its two hands.  Although it does not move you
have a feeling that it watches you wherever you move, ready to attack.

a platinum golem~
A silvery-grey golem slowly strides through the ruined city.
~
A tall, relatively thin golem strides through the ruined streets, peering around
itself for criminals or trouble-makers.  It is the only golem so far that you
have seen to stride, not simply walk in a ponderous fashion.  Its eyes glow, as
if searching for something and it turns its head to examine you for a moment.
As if coming to a conclusion, it turns away and strides forward, again searching
with its glowing eyes.  Upon its chest there is carving of a fist clenching a
hammer with a large sunburst in the background.  Now, the golem simply patrols
the city, looking for criminals that aren't there.

A dull black golem stands here on what is left of the battlements.
~
A tall, wide golem stands here on the former battlements watching for intruders.
You can tell that the golem is made from lead from the dull black color it is.
It is of very poor make, but seems to have done an adequate job watching the
outskirts of its city for invaders. The golem does not move at all, but still
seems to be searching the area past the city walls as if it expects an attack
at any moment. You can tell that the golem has been sitting here for quite some
time for there are many barnacles stuck all over it, giving it a speckled
appearance.  It holds a swords in each hand and you see age old cuts and scrapes
on its chest and arms from battles protecting against invaders.  On its chest
there is a worn carving that you think looks like an outstretched hand, but
from the barnacles and scratches you can't be sure.

brass yellowish golem~
a brass golem~
A yellowish golem stands here, protecting the palace gates.
~
A large, ornate golem stands here, made completely of a yellowish material,
maybe brass or gold.  It guards the gates of the royal palace without moving
an inch and does not even seem to acknowledge your presence in the room.  In
one hand it carries a halberd with a titanium tip.  Once again the golem is
covered with carvings, most of which you do not recognize at all.  A large cup
pouring a liquid into a hole seems to be the most prominent of all the carvings.
Pieces of seaweed have become stuck in the golems fingers and they sway with
the currents of the ocean.  The golem's strangely human face is grim, as if it
knows it is protecting nothing, but you suspect that was the way the golem was
created.  Its arms are again very human, as big as a tree trunk, however. The
torso of the golem is covered with the strange glyphs and sigils and are almost
unrecognizable.  Its legs are as rock-hard as it doubtlessly is, and you are
sure that it would give a hard fight to any that wished to desecrate its palace.

A headless, partially destroyed golem lies here on the battlements.
~
This golem has somehow been partially destroyed by whatever caused this city
to sink beneath the waves.  It is missing its head and one arm, doubtlessly
inhibiting is fighting capabilities.  However, you have heard that golems can
fight even if they are partially destroyed, due to their magical nature.  The
golem is covered with barnacles and seaweed, and if it weren't for the similar
make of the golem you would have thought it was an old statue.  The golem is
missing its sword, but even with its countless disabilities you decide that this
is no easy meat.

a silvery spirit~
A misty silver spirit floats here, watching the city streets.
~
You blink at first when you try to look at this entity, for it is insubstantial
and almost completely transparent.  As you get your eyes into focus you see that
the spirit is watching you with its silvery eyes.  Its face is fair and it looks
to be benevolent with silvery curls of hair hanging in front of its eyes.  It
seems to wear old monk's clothing, but, like the spirit they too are made up of
a silvery mist.  As you look down its torso, the clothes disappear as well as
the skin, organs until at the waist there is only its backbone, which only lasts
a few more inches.   In one of its hands it holds a beautifully crafted sword,
encrusted with jewels of every type.  You realize that the sword is actually
real, unlike the spirit itself.  Luckily, the spirit smiles when it sees that
you are looking at it, and nods in greeting, then goes back to studying
its surroundings.

a grey spirit~
A grey, intangible spirit assesses your presence.

Your eyes have trouble focusing upon the figure in front of you because of its
strange appearance.  Finally the figure becomes clearer and you see that it is
a transparent spirit that floats in the water. It seems to be made of a deep
grey fog, and all of it seems to be transparent and misty.  The spirit itself
stops at the waist, hovering above the ground but it moves as surely as if it
had legs to run upon.  It wears what seems to be tight-fitting leathers, which
are as intangible as the spirit itself.  It carries a simple,  but finely
wrought sword that seems to be made of a light-colored metal and is very real.
The spirit seems to assess your very soul as its steel grey eyes watch you
with an intensity that makes you shiver.

A spirit made of gold mist watches you carefully.

Your eyes sting as you try to focus upon its intangible form that floats in the
water in front of you. It wears misty golden noble's clothes which disappear
around the same time that its lower body does.  It seems to fade out of
existence more and more the lower on the body it is.  At the waist there is only
a faint image of the spirit's backbone, which disappears a few inches down. The
spirit wields two swords, one in each hand.  One looks to be an expensive
rapier, the hilt encrusted with numerous jewels.  The other is a tarnished
silver broadsword, not in as good condition and surely not as effective.  The
spirit's eyes seem to bore into your skull as it watches with an intensity that
makes you shiver.

A menacing shark of gigantic proportions swims through here.
~
A huge grey shark swims through the water, waiting for the scent of blood. Its
two beady eyes are on either side of its head, and it seems to have very poor
eyesight as it clumsily makes its way around.  The shark is a deep grey color,
with speckles of white running down its sides.  It has a long dorsal fin which
reminds you of a sail of a boat.  It opens its mouth periodically and rows upon
rows of sharp jagged teeth show.  You have heard that once a shark loses a
tooth, another from behind will take its place.  You could guess that the
shark's large mouth could easily swallow a dozen small fish whole, and the
cruelly jagged teeth are made to rip larger ones to pieces.  On either side of
its head, a gill swishes out and in out and in, moving the water into the
shark's lungs and providing the oxygen that is needed for it to live.  The
shark slowly swims in your direction, and you shiver, wondering if it will
attack.

A large, grey octopus lies here, half buried in the silt that covers
this home.  Its eight tentacles writhe furiously as it protects its
domain from intruders.  The octopus's single eye races back and forth
in anger and surprise.  Finally, the octopus heaves itself free of the
silt and clacks its beak angrily at you.  It turns its pink underbelly
towards you and you can see the hundreds of suction cups upon each
tentacle.  The tentacles move like individual snakes in the water,
twisting and turning, propelling the octopus towards you at an alarming
rate.  The dust rises in a cloud, obscuring the octopus for a second,
until it rages forward in attack.  The eight arms attack as one and you
feel that you will be hard pressed to survive this encounter.

A strange fish lies on the ocean floor, half-covered with silt and
sand.  The most curious part of it is that the fish seems to be lying
on its side, but two eyes peer up at you momentarily.  Unlike the other
fish that swim by you every so often, this strange fish simply lies on
the ground, not moving at all.  You wonder how it can feed if it stays
in one place all the time.  The fish itself is a tan color, with
speckles of yellow and grey on its side.  It has a large tail fin that
is semi-transparent, and a short but wide dorsal fin.  The fish is not
big, about four hands long and two wide and as thin as your finger. You
wonder if the fish would be good to eat for you have never seen
anything like it before.  The strange fish is completely unconcerned
at your presence.  It simply moves its two eyes back and forth and
moves its mouth every so often.

stripes that go down its sides.  The fish itself is oval shaped, with
tiny scales and long, flowing fins.  Around its tail, the scales become
speckled with lighter colors.  Its eye is black as well, hidden as to
confuse the predators of which side is the fish's head.  Its tail is
small and thin, but it swims fast enough to survive.  A patch around
its mouth is bright yellow, very distinct in comparison to the other
parts of its body.  The dorsal fin is long, thin and flowing, giving it
the look of wings to it.  The fish casually swims along, until it is
startled by an unheard sound and darts off quickly.

a white patch underneath the gills.  It has tight, small scales that
fit like bricks.  The one part of the fish that stands out is its eye.
The eye is small, but is a deep blue, a sharp contrast in comparison to
the almost pink color of the rest of the fish.  It has a thin, wispy
dorsal fin, while its tail is very long and more solid.  The fish swims
along the bottom of the sea floor, nibbling upon everything in its
path, including your feet.  It slides slowly along the sand, looking for
food.

seaweed here, doubtlessly providing ample camouflage from most
predators.  The scales of the fish are thin and almost transparent, you
can see the faint outline of the organs of the fish beneath its skin.
Its fins are completely transparent.  The only way that you know they
are there is from the cartilage supports that always accompany a fish's
fins.  Its eyes are black and bulge outwards as if they will pop out of
its head at any moment.  The fish slowly makes its way towards a patch
of seaweed and nibbles at one of the stalks.  It moves away to another
patch before long though, to avoid predators that might hide in the
patches of seaweed.

A flash of silvery bodies makes you blink twice before you can
concentrate upon the school of fish in front of you.  There must be
hundreds of fish in this large group, all about half a hand long, and
no more than three fingers across.  Each fish has a silver body, with
a large black stripe down the middle.  Their scales glint in the light,
giving off a constant flickering of light.  The entire school moves as
one it seems, although sometimes a fish lags behind, only to be eaten
up by the trailing shark.  The fish don't seem to notice you, they only
are interested in getting away from the shark, finding food and mating
before they die.  You watch as they dart in a futile attempt to avoid
the shark again, and two more fish become a meal.

A small grey shark swims lazily after the large school of fish.  It
probably could swim faster, but it seems that it isn't worth exerting
the energy when it feasts just fine at its present speed.  It is quite
small, probably a young shark, for it continues to eat the fish as if
it hasn't eaten for a year.  Its large gills pump in and out as the
shark swallows yet another fish.  The shark's long grey tail swishes
lazily back and forth, producing enough speed to keep up with the
school but not any more than that.  The shark eyes you quickly, but
decides that a school of fish is much more enticing than a dangerous-
looking adventurer.  The school of fish suddenly darts to the side and
the shark speeds foward, eating two more fish in the process.

A small red crab walks quickly across the street, its feet making a
clacking sound upon the stone street.  It stops as if to regard you,
its eye stalks waving madly.  You can see its small mouth working
constantly if it is eating at all times.  The small crab moves as if
to attack you, waving its thumb-long pincers almost menacingly.  Then,
as if it never intended to attack you at all, it scuttles back to where
it started and begins to regard you again with waving eye stalks.  The
crab soon becomes uninterested in looking at you and begins to walk off
underneath some fallen stones.  You can see its eight red legs work
quickly to propel the crab into safety.  It has two, small pincers
about the same size and seems to be using them against unseen enemies.
Its body is taken up by a small red plate to protect it against the
bites of its predators.  The crab turns around to look at you once
more, warily this time and then scuttles off.

A tiny fish swims quickly through the currents of the sea somehow
seeming to be nervous.  The fish has large eyes compared to the rest
of its body, and they make it the fish seem to have a worried look on
its face.  Its constant moving only adds to the illusion that this
fish is fleeing from something.  Along the body of the fish there are
black and white lines that remind you of an animal you once heard of.
Its tail is not striped, it is completely opaque and a bright white,
most likely for the purpose of attracting predators to attack the
tail of the fish instead of the head.  The strange little fish stops
to nibble upon some seaweed, then darts off in the direction that it
came, looking as nervous as ever.

A bulbous fish swims through here with a strange appendage on its head with what

~
A strange fish swims in front of you, almost grinning the way its teeth
stick out of its mouth. You goggle at the fish for it must be a parody
of life or some sort of strange experiment that was conducted eons ago.
The fish itself looks like an over-stuffed  child's toy.  Its skin seems
that it will burst at the seams any moment.  Furthermore the face of
the strange creature reminds you of an obese dragon, a large crest goes
over its head and teeth stick out of its maw, giving it a fearsome
look.  The strangest part of all is a strange appendage that sticks out
of its forehead.  It seems to be a thin rod of cartilage that ends with
a small ball of flesh.  You start to wonder what its purpose is when
suddenly another fish swims by and suddenly notices the ball.  It
immediately darts for it when suddenly the large fish opens its mouth
to swallow the smaller fish.  Somehow it notices its impending doom and
swims away before it can be eaten.  The strange fish simply stops
movement altogether except for wiggling the lure every once and awhile.

A brown fish swims by quickly looking for something to eat and avoiding
predators.  Almost at once it notices the lure of the strange fish and darts
towards it, expecting a meal.  It is surprised when the larger fish jumps at
it and almost succeeds in ending its life, but it manages to dart away from
the impending doom.  As it swims away, you get a better look at it.  The fish
is a deep brown, with strange scales that are thin and long.  The scales make
the fish seem to take on the quality of hair.  The fish has a broad snout and
a squarish head, giving it the appearance of a cow.  Its large side fins
stick out at an angle that make them look like ears and the crest of the fish
looks vaguely like the mane of a horse.  The fish reminds you of the head of
a cow or horse.  The small brown fish turns around, studying its surroundings
then swims off towards an unseen destination.

anemone~
a sea anemone~
A large sea anemone is here on the ocean floor, trapped fish in its tentacles.
~
A strange plant grows at the bottom of the sea floor.  It has a body shaped
like a vase and is attached to some wreckage of a former building.  The
plant reminds you of a flower, for there seems to be many colorful petals on
the outside of the fish.  They range from bright yellow to deep magenta and
you pause for a moment to admire the beauty of it.  Then, suddenly you notice
several small fish caught within the petals.  You realize that the "petals"
are actually tentacles made for catching passing fish with.  The fish are
held tightly by the tentacles, but strangely they do not struggle at all.
You shiver at the brutality of the sea and hope that you are not the next
victim of it.

a trapped fish~
A small fish is here, trapped in the tentacles of the anemone.
~
A small green fish is hopelessly trapped within the tentacles of the anemone.
The fish does not struggle at all even though it is mortal danger.  Light
yellow tentacles writhe around the fish's body, pulling it closer to the
mouth of the anemone.  The fish has a small body, mostly of a green color,
but there are speckles of white and black near the tail.  Its fins are solid
green with bony protrusions sticking menacingly out of the dorsal fin.
However, the protective spikes obviously did nothing to protect the fish from
being dragging to its doom by the sea anemone.  Its dark eyes are glazed over
as if it is paralyzed or already dead.  The tentacles stop pulling the fish
for a moment, and suddenly the small fish thrashes, trying to escape.  The
tentacles tighten again and the fish's eyes glaze over and stops thrashing.
Once again, the tentacles pull the fish closer to the open mouth of the
anemone.

A grey fish is struggling to be free of the tentacles clutching its tail.
~
A medium sized grey fish is here, struggling to be free from the anemone
tentacles that clutch its tail.  The fish swims frantically for a few seconds
then stops, resting for a few more.  The tentacles begin to pull the fish
closer to the main body of the anemone where it will be eaten.  At the last
moment though, the fish once again starts to thrash, gaining some ground away
from the other waiting tentacles.  This happens again and again, the fish
struggles, gaining ground, but while it rests it is pulled closer.  When
the fish stops thrashing for the fifth time, you study it closer.  Its body
is a bright silver with a single stripe of green and speckles of white and
black.  You watch as the fish struggles yet another time and is dragged back
once again.

A fish half eaten by the anemone twitches convulsively.
~
You can only see half of this fish, for the rest is in the digestive tracts
of the anemone.  The fish is still alive, incredibly and twitches every so
often in a pitiful attempt to escape.  It once was a very beautiful fish, but
now its skin has been torn at the midsection and there are scales floating
everywhere.  From what you can see the fish was very colorful, a plethora of
colors creating a rainbow of beauty.  Of course, the anemone cannot see the
beauty of the fish, it lives only to survive.  The fish continues to struggle
for freedom, but gets nowhere.

fish fat ugly fiend fisherman's~
a fisherman's fiend~
A fat ugly fish swims slowly across the sea floor.
~
You take one look at this fish and recognize it instantly.  This is an
infamous fish amongst fishermen and sea captains.  The fish is sickly brown,
with what seems to be a fungus growing all over it.  However, the fish is
not actually sick, rather it is has always been this ugly since the time it
hatched from an egg.  Fishermen around Shalar despise these fishes because
they are so greedy of eating the bait.  Of course they seem to be a good catch
until the farmer sees that they are useless.  The course meat of the fish is
inedible, completely disgusting.  The bones of the fish are greasy and
brittle, no tools can be made from them.  Finally, the fish is so ugly that
no man would even think of making a trophy of it, no matter what the size of
the fish.  You remember how many times in your youth you were exited to have
a bite on your line, only to find it was a fisherman's fiend and have to throw
it back.  You wonder what a fiend is doing all the way down in the sea, but
dismiss it for there are these fish in all corners of Shalar.

Before you see a fish of legends come to life.  Everyone knows that a dragon
fish is a sign of good luck and catching one is a rare occurrence indeed.  You
remember how a traveling king would be offered a dragon fish for his meal or
what prices the delicious meat of the dragon fish would bring in.  You look
at this almost legendary fish in awe.  Everything about it is perfect.  The
bright green of it is dazzling and it puts emeralds to shame.  Its orange
crest is sharp and shiny and its teeth gleam like ivory.  The dragon fish in
all its elegance swims by like any other fish and goes to nibble upon some
seaweed.  Even with the sobering truth in front of you, you cannot rip your
gaze away from the fish that was in your dreams as a child.

a goryt fish~
A strange white fish with bony protrusions that look like horns swims by.
~
The fist thing that you notice about this fish is that its bones grow right
out of its head and look quite a bit like horns.  The fish is pure white
except for its scales which are a deep brown.  The fish does not seem to be
overbalanced by the horns, on the contrary, it swims like any other fish that
you have seen.  It has a blunt head and small wispy whiskers that come off of
its chin.  The fish turns towards you for a moment you let out a small laugh.
The fish, coupled with the 'horns' and the whiskers, looks almost exactly like
a ram or goat.  However, the fish acts like any other that you have seen in
the sea.  Finally, after nibbling on some seaweed and swimming in a few
circles, the strange fish swims off into the murky distance.

a giant electric eel~
A giant, scaleless eel seems to slither through the water here.
~
A long bluish-brown eel swims through the water with an ease that almost seems
unnatural for a creature of its shape.  Unlike most fish the eel is shaped more
like a thick snake.  Its dorsal and caudal fins are a transparent brown and
seem to aid in the eel's movement through the murky water.  Its large tail
is bordered by an opaque, seemingly thick fin that provides most of the
movement through the water through slow undulations of the eel's entire long
body.  Unlike most other sea animals the eel's outer skin is not made up of
hundreds of scales.  Rather, a hairless bluish brown skin makes up the outer
portion of its body.  The eel seems to be very sluggish, almost lazy, since it
moves so slowly.  However, you have heard that eels can be fiercely territorial
and you doubt that this one is any exception.

A deep purple fish swims quietly through the murky depths here.  Its whole
body is the same dark color, making the fish seem evil.  Its fins are a
different story completely.  Instead of the dreary color that the rest of the
fish is, they are a bright white and even under the water you squint your
eyes painfully at the sharp contrast of the two opposite colors.  The
strangest part of the fish is that its eyes are completely black.  Most of the
other fish that you have seen have an outline around the eyes.  This fish
however has eyes of the blackest of nights, again giving it a sinister
look.

a bull fish~
A large brownish fish swims slowly amongst the wreckage of the city.
~
The bull fish is named for its size and nothing else.  Certainly it doesn't
have the temper of a bull, nor the ferocity of one.  The bull fish can range
from up to five hundred pounds, but this one seems to be around one-hundred
pounds, a normal size for the fish.  Much meat can be cut from bull fish,
and fishermen made much money from catching these in Arkham and New Thalos
Unfortunately, in many places they have been over-fished and fewer
remain nowadays.  The fish is shaped like an oval and is as big as a bull.
Its huge fins sweep back and forth to propel the large fish through the
water.  Its brownish scales cover most of the fish, except for a green patch
around its eye, and a black stripe along the bottom of its tail.

A tiny grey clam lies here in the silt.  It certainly is quite pretty for the
shine of its shell.  The clam must have been here for a long time, for the
sand has been piled up on the sides of the clam, almost burying it.  Still,
even through the sand you can see the flawless shell of the clam.  Every so
often it opens the shell to allow some water in.  You can see a small pearl
inside the clam whenever it opens.  You stop to wonder how such a creature
could live if it doesn't even have a mouth to eat with.  Again the clam
opens and you can see the soft inside body of the clam behind the sparkling
pearl.  The clam has doubtlessly lived a long live because of its natural
protection from predators.  Once again the clam opens and you can see the
pearl sparkling.

You wonder why such a fish would survive long if it let off light advertising
its location.  Even so, the fish swims along like any other and nibbles upon
some seaweed.  The entire fish is a slight yellow color, with patches of light
pink and green near the various fins of the fish.  Its eye however, is a
deep black, an almost painful contrast to the shining whiteness of the rest
of it.  The fish is not big, about two hands across and three fingers wide.
The fish's fins are about as big as your fist and propel the fish at a fair
speed.

must have collapsed hundreds of years ago for a different type of fish to live
purely in the blackness of the destroyed temple.  The fish swims blindly
around, living completely by its auditory and sense of touch.  The fish gropes
around for food, swimming into a fallen ceiling, it begins to eat the algae
that lives there.  After hitting its head against the rock a few times it
turns around and swims in the opposite direction, still looking for precious
food.

pincers sway back and forth as it warily moves out of hiding and into a large
open area.  The creature much smaller than any lobster that you have ever
seen but does not seem to be a younger version of a lobster either.  Its thin
body is protected by numerous red plates that interlock in a complicated
sequence.  The small lobster has two long antennae that seem to be its only
sense for as soon as its they touch an obstacle of some sort, it moves away
in the opposite direction as if it had seen the rock itself.  Presently, the
small lobster finally decides that there is nothing of danger out in the
open and finally sits still, its antennae waving with the currents of water.

does nothing to help.  Finally, as the jellyfish swims in front of a piece of
rock you can make out more of its features.  It has an almost spherical body,
but it almost seems the bottom part was cut off with a knife.  Out of the
open bottom, dozens of tentacles trail through the water, coated with a
strong chemical that the jellyfish secretes that will cause extreme agony
and paralysis.  Small fish shy away from the jellyfish as they would be
quickly caught and digested if they did not.  Inside the spherical body, you
can see misty parts floating, doubtlessly organs of some type, although you
cannot begin to guess what they are.  The jellyfish slowly drifts through the
water, its deadly tentacles waving with the currents.

silverpike fish~
a silverpike~
A long, thin, silver fish smoothly glides through the water.
~
You study this fish and realize that it is quite familiar.  It is a fish
called a silverpike.  Renowned for its ferocity and aggressive amongst
fishermen, it is a hard catch to keep, for it struggles once in the net, and
does not stop until either the nets have ripped or the silverpike is brought
on land.  Even on dry ground it will bite and snap in its last seconds of life,
and many fishermen have lost fingers to the final struggle of the silverpike.
The silverpike has a long but thin body, giving the impression that it is
frail, which is a large understatement.  Its head is angular at the tip and
as thin as the rest of its body.  The mouth sports many sharp gleaming teeth,
the bane of younger fishermen and their nets.  The silverpike swims by, a
dangerous gleam in its eye, daring you to attack.

Before walks the largest lobster you have ever seen in your life.  Each of
its pincers is as big as a man and you do not doubt they could cut one in half
as well.  The lobster is a light grey-green, with algae growing all over its
body, adding to the strange color.  Its huge body is as big as seven oxen and
most likely twice as strong.  Plates of protective armor cover the huge beast,
making it nearly impossible to even scratch.  You believe that a well-placed
blow between the ridges of the armor could hurt the beast, but any other
attack seems inconceivable.  The two antennae of the huge lobster wave back
and forth wildly, somehow as if they sense your presence.  The lobster begins
to move forwards, towards you, opening and closing its pincers, giving off a
menacing clacking sound.

sword is of the same make as the others you have seen in the city, it handles
it with a care of a true sword master.  The spirit has a body of a normal human
until the waist, where everything but its spinal cord disappears, and even that
fades out of existence a few inches down.  The spirit's misty hair is well-

brown seaweed.  The sahuagin's human-like chest is a light tan, while in
stark contrast its back, turns to a dark green with speckles of black and
brown.  A large spined fin runs down its back, slightly translucent and
waving slightly in accordance with the undersea currents.  Its large
webbed feet look like they would make this creature a powerful swimmer.
The Prince probably commanded this raider to scout the reports of the
sunken city in search of valuable treasure.  Unfortunately, the sahuagin

no weapons in its hands, you suspect that its sharp claws are just as
formidable as any blade.  The sahuagin's chest is a pale white while its
back is a light green, excellent camouflage in seaweed.  A translucent red
fin runs down its hard back, sharp spines protruding outwards.  It wears
a simple loin-cloth and a waist-pouch, both made of dark brown seaweed.
This sahuagin was probably ordered by the Prince to scout this sunken city
in search of valuable treasures.  Judging from the numerous bulges in its
pouch, this sahuagin seems to have been very successful.  Its midnight
black eyes watch you carefully and it swims forward to attack.

the water.  The sahuagin's chest is a light green, while its back turns
slowly to a darker complexion, speckled with motes of black and brown.
The sahuagin wears only a simple loin-cloth and a large sack tied around
one of its arms.  Both are made from a coarse, dark brown seaweed that is
vcrudely woven together.  This sahuagin is probably with the scouting
party
except its job is to provide food for the hungry scouts and raiders.  It
methodically stabs at a passing fish with its sharp trident.  You notice
that its coarse sack seems to be completely full with the mangled bodies
of various fish.  The sahuagin looks carefully around for something more
interesting to hunt than mere fish.

This short sahuagin floats here in the murky waters, glaring around
itself with extreme hatred.  Although it has the general body of a
humanoid, its head is that of a hideous fish.  It is quite short, and
does not seem to be as heavily muscled as you have heard sahuagins to
normally be.  While its legs are thin, you suspect that its large webbed
feet would propel it quickly through the water.  Its chest is a sickly
brown while its back is a deep brownish-green, with many speckles of
black as well.  Around its small body, this sahuagin wears a finely-
woven black cloak that seems to have some importance.  Around its
scrawny neck it wears various crude unholy symbols.  You sense an aura
of unholy power around this small sahuagin and suspect that it is the
one that brought the raiding party here.  The small sahuagin hisses
in defiance and seems ready to kill anyone it notices.

~
This strange globe of flashing colors and whirling lights almost mesmerizes
you for a moment as its shimmering surface creates a hypnotic pattern.  The
strange sphere is obviously of magical construct but you cannot tell what
purpose it would serve a magician.  The globe is about as big as a human head,
but its size varies slightly from moment to moment.  The water around the
sphere is uncomfortably warm, and small bubbles float upwards from it.  The
globe itself is slightly translucent, almost as if it is not completely in
this plane of reality.  Strangely enough, it seems to avoid you if you come
too near, almost as if it is a moving target of some sort.  You can hear a
soft humming around the sphere, intensified by the water.

the Eye of the Deep~
An enormous beholder-like creature with large pincers floats forward to attack.
~
This fearsome creature seems to slightly resemble the legendary beholders, but
there are obvious differences that make it much more horrifying.  Its body is
in the general shape of a sphere, reddish in color and formed from a tough
bone-like material.  An enormous eye dominates the front of its body, the
colors strangely reversed.  The sclera is a deep blue-black, the iris is a
musty white and the pupil is a deep black oval.  Below the large eye, there
are two orifices which are most likely its respiratory system.  A fearsome maw,
large enough to swallow a giant and is filled with dozens of sharp teeth.  Upon
the top of its spherical body, there are two tentacle-like appendages which end
in jet-black eyes.  The two eye-stalks seem to act independently, keeping watch
around the creature at all times.  Two large pincers, covered with hardened
chitin, hang from the bottom of the beholder, their ridged edges razor-sharp.
Upon its back, there are a multitude of sharp spines, further protecting this
horrific creature.  As the strange beholder notices you, it moves forward, eyes
crackling with magic and filled with hatred, ready to kill you quickly and
without mercy.

"250 FG, Week of the Seal, Mining Report of Capt. Ahyrt"

-The city counsel has approved my petition to begin excavation in the western
foothills of Kuhara, our mages believe there are rich mineral resources there.
I have requested fifty miners to begin the initial mine and two attendants of
Tcar to help with any medical or spiritual complications that might arise.
With the belief that there is a rich platinum mine, I am assured that Kuhara
will remain a major trading leader with such success that we will attract the
attention of the almighty Tcar.  Plans for a camp nearby the future mine have
already been sent to and approved by the council of commerce.  Scouts are
blazing the quickest path to the mine site and soon our engineers will make
a road so the wagon trains will be able to move with speed.

"250 FG, Week of the Kelp, Mining Report of Capt. Ahyrt"

-I am pleased to announce that we have tested the mine in the western
foothills and we believe we have found the largest concentration of platinum
that anyone has reported in the history of Kuhara.  Already the city council
is offering me five hundred men to mine the area and ten attendants of Tcar.
I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered my own office to oversee the
entire mining expedition and ten secretaries to help me in my job.  Countless
men are sending in their applications to be miners and for the first time in
my life I must turn some of these men away because I have plenty already.
The scouts have determined the fasted route to the mine and the engineers have
begun the deforestization process.  I hope the mine shall begin in another
week.

"250 FG, Week of the Tsunami, Mining Report of Capt. Ahyrt"

-The actual mining has just begun and our predictions for the amount of
platinum in the western foothills was dwarfed the amount found.  Truly this is
a blessing from the bountiful and glorious Tcar himself, for not even his
avatars could provide such luck and bounty as this.  The "camp" that I had
planned for the mine has turned into a small city with plans for a law
enforcement and walls already submitted to the council.  Several high
marshals have hinted that if I continue my wise decisions I will be
promoted to the rank of Merchant Captain.  Unfortunately, the price I will
have to pay for this will be little sleep and no time to myself.  My entire
day is filled with important decisions or interviews which leaves little time
for anything else.  It is for the glory of Tcar that I will oversee this
expedition and see that it succeeds.

"251 FG, Week of Dragonfish, Mining Report of Merchant Lord Ahyrt."

-Much has happened since my last entry.  I shall have to try to fit the course
of many weeks in this one hasty sitting.  As foreseen, the mine has become a
huge success, but none could foresee that it would become the heart of Kuhara.
The platinum that the mines, and by now there are more than one, produce is
more than what Kuhara has produced in the last ten years.  Trading has
increased tenfold and we are trading for metals such as adamantite, mithril,
and titanium.  Our mages have seen a boost in knowledge that even the elders
are amazed by.  I see animated golem guards walk the streets now, rendered from
the metals we mine and trade.  Much to my pleasure (and well deserved) I have
been promoted to the high rank of Merchant Lord.  An entire house is devoted to
my work and a score of servants follow me around wherever I go.  Soon, I feel,
I may be called upon to serve on the High Council.  The mine itself seems to be
endless for however deep we dig, there always seems to be more platinum to be
found.  Blessed Tcar, in has unendless wisdom, has shown favor to our city by
causing a shortage of platinum in the rest of the world so the prices of ours
rise.  A small city has grown around the mine and many in the world know of
the Gold-filled Goblet sigil of the mine.

"251 FG, Week of the Kelp, Mining Report of Council Member Ahyrt."

-The blessing of Tcar is truly upon us.  No matter how deep we dig and at
what rate, the platinum is still bountiful.  It seems that the platinum is
all over the island, it is only the matter of how deep it may be.  Golems now
control the arbitration of the cities along with some spirits the priests
have conjured up in the name of Tcar.  The guild of musicians has combined
their efforts with those of the golem animators to produce magical horns of
platinum that when sounded by the golems will alert the others to help control
the area.  Plans are underway for a new set of manacles that will be made out
of specially blessed platinum.  Under the might of Tcar, fear will drive thieves
from Kuhara.

"251 FG, Week of the Seahorse, Mining Report of Merchant Lord Ahyrt."

-I have now been promoted to the City Council.  With such important duties that
will now be placed upon me, I will have little time to write.  I feel I will
only have time to include the news of utmost importance.  The mine seems to be
flourishing like always and there seems to be a limitless amount of platinum
beneath the island.  Our trading has increased another tenfold and already
people from across the world come to gaze upon the riches of Kuhara.  We have
successfully driven poverty away and crime has dropped to almost nil.  The once
despised job of a miner is now eagerly sought after, and with all the platinum
beneath the island we continue to require more workers.  Our priests are
receiving powerful supplications from Tcar himself, for people have been
resurrected successfully several times.  The temples of Tcar have been built
wherever there is room, and the main one in the heart of Kuhara is as big
as many small towns are.  The blessing of Tcar himself must be upon us for all
the riches we have acquired.  I fear this is all the time I have for writing.
For the next year the council members will tour the island of Kuhara and I am
positive that it will take every minute of my days to do so.
May Tcar fill your cup!

"252 FG, Week of the Dolphin, Mining Report of Council Member Ahyrt"

-After touring the entire island of Kuhara with the other Council Members I
have come to the conclusion that the Mines of Tcar is an incarnation of the
all-powerful god himself.  The amount of platinum that is beneath the island
is beyond belief, and I even at the current pace that we mine the island I
predict that there will be a good ten years of a steady supply of platinum.
However, a small upcry has been started by a fool by the name of Retrar Nymath,
an apprentice mage.  His claims are that the Mines of Tcar will destroy the
civilization of Kuhara somehow.  He was arrested on the charges of creating a
violent riot and now is in the holding cube.  I only mention his name so I
may look back upon the fool who claimed that Kuhara would fail because of the
platinum mines.  This is all I have time to write, for I must be off to
oversee the construction of a new mine in the southeastern plains.  I am sure
that this mine like the others will provide ample platinum.
May Tcar fill your cup!

"252 FG, Week of the Octopus, Mining Report of Council Member Ahyrt"

-The new year approaches and cold southern winds have begun to blow into
Kuhara.  I find mixed news upon my desk as I return from overseeing the opening
of the fifth Mine of Tcar in the southeastern plains.  Once again, platinum
intake is large and trade is continuing to grow at a steady rate as always.
More and more ships inhabit the ports every day and we can barely keep up with
the demand for our wonderful sculptures and weavings.  On the other hand I find
grave news on my desk as well.  Reports of numerous earthquakes near farms
have been recorded and several hundred farmers mill nervously around the
palace, waiting for an answer.  Worse, several mines have collapsed in these
earthquakes and many sinkholes have been found around the island.  One hundred
and fifty-seven deaths have been attributed to the collapse of several mine
shafts and many other miners report shaking and dust clouds in some of the
deeper mines.  I have no choice but to cancel my present meetings and hearings
to go immediately to one of the mines to see if a faulty shaft design is the
culprit.  Moreover, the fool Nymath has begun yelling that we must all flee
the island to save our lives.  No one believes him of course, but I must check
to see what problem ails our important mines.
May Tcar fill your cup!

and could probably hold a small number of things.  The pouch has a thin
string of twisted seaweed that serves as a drawstring in case you wish to
close the pouch from prying hands.  The entire pouch is attached to a thick
string of twisted seaweed, which has a double loop connected to itself in
order to allow you to tighten or loosen the string in accordance to your
body size.  The string looks like it would fit perfectly over your shoulder
and tighten at your waist as there are small pads of woven kelp as so the
tight string does not dig into your skin.  The tough string of twisted
seaweed could maybe provide a feeble defense against all numbers of attacks.

This large pouch is loosely woven from long strands of a tough, brown kelp
and could probably hold quite a few items.  The pouch has a thin string of
twisted seaweed that is threaded through holes in the pouch near the top
to serve as a drawstring.  The large pouch is securely attached to a small
loop of tough twisted seaweed.  The string of seaweed is tied in such a way
as so you can loosen or tighten it in accordance to size.  The pouch looks
as if it is made to be tied around your arm as there is a soft pad of kelp
on one side that would probably reduce the uncomfortable rubbing against
your side.  The tough twisted string of seaweed could probably serve as a
feeble defense against all numbers of attacks.

This spear is very long in length and the shaft is made from a tough wood
that seems to be magically enchanted for strength and durability.  The
shaft is extremely smooth, almost as if it has been washed smooth by water
over time.  A small opal is embedded at the end of the shaft and hums with
an inner strength.  Faint carvings of waves run up the the shaft of the
spear and allow for a stronger grip upon the weapon with your hands.  The
steel blade is wickedly barbed and would probably cause extreme pain if
thrust into an opponent.  The blade is extremely hard and you suspect that
it is enchanted with magic in order to increase its durability, strength
and effectiveness.  The spear is relatively light for its size, and you
suspect that magic is once again at work.

You float in the water before a large forest of kelp that is incredibly

the cloudy seascape makes it hard to see very far.  The currents are very
strong here, not allowing you to swim upwards towards the surface.  The sea
life swims through here, paying you little attention.  Looking more closely
at the forest of kelp you suddenly notice that there is a small path that
leads straight to the south.  You stop to wonder what could force the huge
stalks of kelp to grow in the shape of a small path.  Looking to your north

The stone path is just as eroded here as the beginning and in places the
entire path disappears beneath the silt for a few feet.  The path takes a
sharp turn here towards the east but you cannot tell what lies there because
of the murky sea. Two large columns of the same material as the path lie
in pieces to the south.  Pieces of kelp and numerous fish float through here,
but most of the sea life pays you no mind.  Every once and awhile you think
you see a swimming form as large as twenty men, but you must be mistaken.
You notice that as you progress further and further down the path, the water's
temperature has begun to rise.  To your south you think you see a huge shadow
through the forest of kelp.  The water here is very murky, filled with enough
dust as to slightly obscure sight.

tell, what it is you cannot guess however.   The forest of kelp has begun to
fade a bit, but with the murkiness of the ocean you would probably get lost
without the guidance of the path.  The only exits that you can take are to the

civilization thrived here, but it has long since been abandoned.  Nature has

The battlements here allow you to see quite far across the entire surrounding
area.  You can see all of the city to your south.  Closest to you, there is
what seems to be a road full of large houses, most of which are two stories
high and must have at least ten rooms.  Further south you can see the main
residential area of the city, small one-room houses where the majority of the
city obviously lived at one time.  At the southern end of the city you can
barely make out two large buildings, although at this distance you cannot
determine the nature of either.  To your side you see a small crumbling
staircase that leads back down to the gates below.  The cracked battlements
continue to your east and west.

west, although you cannot gain entrance to them here.  The street is flat
stone, not cobblestones like most cities, but cracks cover its surface.  Blue-
green plants grow from these cracks and you see small fish swim amongst the
buildings.  Obviously, nature has begun to retake what once was civilization.
A large sigil is carved into the center of the street, bearing a picture.

You have come to a large intersection of two streets, creating a large square,
at one point a place for commerce.  Now, all that remains is a large seal in
the middle of the square, and a stone fountain off to the side.  Long stalks of
seaweed grow from every crack in the street, giving it the appearance of a
grassy field. To your east you can see a long, thin street that connects with
many, small buildings which seem to be shops and stores.  To your west you can
see a long wide road that on either side there are large, expensive-looking
buildings, guilds or merchant houses of some type.  You can see the residential
area of the city to your south, and the gates of the city lie back to the

The seal is rended from a fine gold that has survived the trials of the eroding

east and west. In the middle of the cracked intersection, there is a large
circle of gold.  The cracked street is filled with sea life, from simple fish
to a translucent jellyfish.  Less amounts of seaweed grow here than other parts
of the city, but for what reason you cannot begin to guess.  To the north and
south, the main street continues its path down the middle of the inner city.

here, paying you no mind at all.  To your east and west you can see the old,
crumbling walls of two houses.  Directly to your north you can see this street
intersecting with a smaller one that leads to the houses of the abandoned city.

buttresses and incredibly built columns.  It seems to be in relatively decent
condition, but you can tell that parts of its beauty have been washed away
forever by the constant wearing of the water.  The building on the east is
rather uninteresting in the fact it has no adornments and is a simple
rectangular shape.  It is made from a dark grey stone that you have never seen
before.  Farther to the east you can see that part of the grey structure has
appeared to have completely collapsed, although there not enough broken rock
for that to make sense.

walls of the large palace, but you cannot see any entrance here.  To your west
you see the grey stone of a large and plain building, its purpose you cannot
tell.  To the north you can go towards the residential area of the city and
eventually the abandoned market as well.  Looking southward you believe that

palace looms to your east and you are captured at the beautiful architecture
that has survived the punishment of the water.  To your west you see the high
walls of a large, seemingly plain structure that is made from a strange, dark
grey stone. You can proceed to the abandoned houses to the north, or you can

E `floral carvings' floral~
The floral carvings near the top of each of the pillars is relatively simple.
There is a small bushel of three-petaled flowers with a small dolphin jumping
from within them.  Each of the carvings is masterfully done but cracks have
begun to appear.  On a few of the pillars parts of the sculptures have fallen
off.
~
E pillar pillars~
The large pillars are made from the same light grey stone as the rest of the
palace.  All eight of the tall pillars are used to provide support.  They are
well made although cracks have begun to appear, due to the punishment of the
eroding water.  The main cylindrical part of each of the pillars is without
adornment, although towards the area where the pillar meets the roof of the
palace there are numerous floral carvings that you can see.
~
E statues~
You have a hard time seeing most of the statues as they are on the high roof
of the palace.  From what you can see, most of them seem to be jumping
dolphins, but about ten more appear to be robed men.  Several of the statues
are unrecognizable as they have been broken away, but most are finely made and
have survived the test of time underwater quite well.
~
E architecture~
The architecture of the palace to your east is astounding in both the enormity
of it all and the detail that was obviously put into it.  The large stone
buttresses are incredible and must have taken years to built.  The pillars that
surround and support the palace are perfect in design and are beautiful to look
at.  You can see dozens of carved statues far above you near the roof of the
palace, most of which are still in decent condition.  You could literally spend
days admiring the beautiful architecture of the palace, but you doubt you have
enough time for that.
~
E writings~
On the border of each circle of carvings there is the repeating script carved
with a flowing hand:

        "May Tcar guide our decisions, and show us the right path."

~
E carving carvings~
The carvings are extremely detailed and are identical on each gate door. They
depict eight robed men seated at a single table with a ghostly dolphin hovering
above them.  A circle of waves surround the eight men and you can see tiny
dolphins jumping gracefully at an even interval.  Finally at the outer reaches
of the carving there are menacing looking sharks and ships that are steadily
swimming and sailing away from the eight men and the dolphin.
~
E gates gate~
The gates of the former palace to your east are absolutely stunning in beauty.
They are made from platinum and carvings and writings cover their surfaces.
There are enough precious gems upon each gate door to ransom ten kings.  The
jewels form the patterns of a simple dolphin, its nose facing towards the
ivory handles that allow you to open the gates.  The gate doors are bordered
with plated gold that are carved in the image of graceful waves.  Unfortunately
all the gems are firmly stuck into the platinum doors and resist all efforts
to pull them free.  Even the gold borderings and ivory handles cannot be
marred, suggesting that the entire gates are magical.

The street is cracked and filled with deep and wide potholes, making you glad

every crack, making the street take on the appearance of a strange forest.
Colorful sea life swims everywhere, unconcerned with your presence, and the fact
that their home was once a immense city.  To your east you can see the walls of
the palace, but there is no way in as far as you can see.  To your west is the
wall of a large, plain building made from a grey stone.  North you think you
can see the gates to the palace, but with all the seaweed you cannot tell.  To

buildings.

The door is completely smooth and is made from a strange grey stone that seems
to be quite indomitable.  The handle is also smoothly carved from the grey
stone and is cool to the touch even in the water.  About ten hands up upon the

from it.  You swear that every so often portions of the ground shift every so
slightly, but it might just be your eyes playing tricks.  To your east and west
the walls of two large buildings block your passage.  To the south you see the
large wall of the city, and judging from your current position you must not be

of the sea seems to avoid this place.  The palace to your east ends along with
the grey building to your west.  Looking to the south you can quickly see that
the gates have been destroyed and no one can leave the city in that direction.
Part of the battlements has collapsed, crushing the gates and creating an
impassable barrier.  To your north you can see the road continues, away from the

was created by a natural disaster, probably a small earthquake.  Looking into
the crevasse, you can see the broken rock on either side that descends into
darkness as far as you can see.  The water around here is unnaturally warm and
it seems to originate from the crevasse and you are careful to stay away from
its unstable edges.

Inside the Southern Gate~
The gate before you is completely destroyed and will never allow anyone to
leave the city from this direction.  Part of the battlements above the gate
must have weakened to the point of collapse for now the gate is crushed beneath
a large piece of stone. All around you the ocean is still.  No sea life swims
through here and not one stalk of seaweed or kelp grows.  The water is
unnaturally warm and you are careful to avoid the large holes in the ocean
floor.  You only exit is to return to your north where it seems a bit safer.

E battlements~
The tall battlements were made from the same stone as many of the buildings
that you have seen in these ruins.  You can tell that the walls reached high
off the ground, but now they have been shattered of their integrity and have
crumbled in many places.  Unfortunately, the crumbled battlements block any
passage south and you feel that the strong currents above you would not allow
you to swim over the wreakage.  The once beautiful gates has been crushed by
the heavy battlements and shall never allow anyone to pass through the
platinum arch.
~
E gate gates~
The once beautiful gate is now completely crushed beneath a fallen section of
the battlement wall.  Judging from the cracked and unstable ocean floor, this
was probably the work of a natural disaster.  You can see the twisted platinum
form of the gate peeking out from underneath a large pile of fallen stone.
Even from this distance you can see the sparkle of numerous precious gems and
gold.  The piles of broken stone effectively block the southern exit and you
doubt there is any way to get past them.

This street leads to the east through a plaza of ruined stores and shops.  A

is astounding.  Even some huge sharks swim amongst the plethora of sea life but
as far as you can tell they do not notice you.  To the north and south there

The street has somewhat merged with the ocean floor in the respect that there

comparison to the fish and seaweed around them, not the other way around.  To

The sand here has become quite deep and you can see that the see life takes
advantage of it for protection.  A shorter green type of seaweed grows the most
predominantly here, swaying in the cold currents.  The colorful sea life seems
to be constantly moving through the murky depths as if in a hurry. All of the
buildings around you are in a dilapidated shape.  Pieces of walls have fallen
off, huge cracks mar the stone roofs.  To the north and south there are stone
structures that are each in terrible conditions.  Above its entrance to the

in the shape of a jumping dolpin, portrayed with extreme detail.  The carving
is masterfully done and you can see the detail and effort that must have been
put into this work of art.  A small message is carved beneath the picture that
is slightly faded, reads:

As you walk in the ankle-deep silt here you notice flecks of stone and metal

stone that obscure vision.  Looking to your south you can see the reason of the
flakes in the water.  A huge pillar has collapsed, crushing the former shop to
your south.  To your north is a crumbling building that while missing huge

You can barely make out a small message underneath one of the carvings of a

reads:

                "To be giving is to be holy."

                                                     --Rantim Nyshat

~
E carvings~
The large pillar is covered with small carvings of jumping dolphins that are
each surrounded by a sunburst.  Each dolphin is extremely detailed and you can
only the amount of work that was put into carving these beautiful images.
While they are detailed, the water has taken its toll upon the carvings and
some have been washed away forever.  Underneath some of the jumping dolphins
there are small carved messages.  Almost all have been washed away except for
one, that you think you can read.
~
E pillar~
The pillar is absolutely gigantic, taller than any other you have seen in your
life.  You can see the smooth top of the pillar here and the rest continues
to the east.  It must have fallen after being weakened by the water and has
crushed the building to your south.  You can still make out large carvings of
dolphins that cover the entire surface of the pillar.  You can see the rest of
the pillar to your east, and it seems that it has crushed a shop in that
direction too.

End of a Side Street~
The silt here is quite deep here, and is mixed with pieces of stone.  A large
pillar has collapsed, crushing the building to your south, and filling the
water with pieces of rock. All you can see of the pillar is its base, the rest
extends to the west. You can see the duplicate of the pillar standing to your
north, and although it is full of cracks, it still stands.  To your north you
can see a ruined building, that looks for the most part to be safe to enter.

~
E message~
The message is carved deeply into the pillar and has avoided the erosion of the
water.  It is a leering script that reads:

                "The pillar of vexations stands before you
                 By the holy mandates of Tcar, do not live
                 These sins else you be sent to a horrible
                 Land of damnation and a fate of suffering"


~
E carvings~
The strange carvings of the vines that circumvent the base of the pillar are
evil-looking, with thorns oozing poison.  The snakes also go around the pillar
and are biting their own tail with a wicked maw.  The sharks are carved with
extreme detail and you can see the effort that was put into making them look
as evil as possible.  The sharks' large maw is opened wide and their malevolent
eyes seem to follow you wherever you go.  The crescent moon carved behind each
shark reminds you of a curved dagger.
~
E pillar~
The pillar that stands to your north is in better condition that its fallen
companion to the south.  Although its base is filled with cracks and holes,
it does not threaten to collapse.  Around the base there are strange carvings
of vines and snakes.  Looking far above you, you can see the pillar reaches
high into the water, casting a wavy shadow to your south.  Just above you,
there is a message carved deep into the pillar.  Above that there are carvings
of sharks outlined by a crescent moon.  These carvings of sharks continue high
out of sight on the pillar.  Underneath each of the sharks there is a small
writing that is carved, unfortunately only one shark is low enough for you to
make out what it reads.
~
E wordings~
The writing is carved deeply into the stone and has resisted most of the
eroding effects of the water.  It is written in a slanted and delicate script
that reads:

                "The pillar of virtues stands before you
                 Live by these rules and your life shall
                 Be as complete as the shell of the clam"

~
E floral~
The bands of floral carving provide some beauty for the base of the fallen
pillar.  They mostly depict a large vine that circles around to meet itself
on the other side with three-petaled flowers that grow from the vine.  Although
the carvings are beautiful, the water has washed away most of their detail.
~
E base~
The base of the large pillar is all that you can see here.  The rest of the
fallen column extends to the west, crushing a building in that direction too.
The base is cracked in many places and you can understand that this was the
reason for the collapse of the pillar.  Bands of floral carvings circle around
the base of the pillar.  While the carvings are detailed, you can tell that
the water has taken washed away much of their beauty.  Above the carvings there
is a wordings carved into the stone.  You can see carvings of jumping dolphins
surrounded by a sunburst that extend with the rest of the pillar to the west.

The building here is filled with deep silt and chunks of stone litter the
sandy floor.  The ceiling is completely gone and the walls are riddled with
cracks.  The entire structure seems ready to collapse at any moment, so you
proceed carefully.  On the northern side you see two large stone ovens, now
filled with silt and barnacles. Nothing else of the bakery remains except for
a large stone counter on the eastern side. Sprouts of seaweed have begun to
grow through the floor and the sea life has already made this building its
home.  You can return to the small street to the south.

A large stone counter was carved from the eastern wall of the building.  A
faint carving of a jumping dolphin with a strange triangular loaf of bread
behind it.  It once was made to hold many delicious baked goods but now it

~
E ovens oven~
The ovens are made of stone and are each one large cubical block.  You can see
an area at the bottom of each where a fire would be started to provide the
heat.  A large opening near the middle is where a platter of uncooked dough
would be placed.  All that fills the ovens now is a thin layer of silt, sand
and hundreds of small barnacles.  Deep within one of the ovens you think you
see some movement, but it may just be a trick of the water.

This building was obviously once the butchery, but has long since been
abandoned.  The sand is ankle-height here, and the seaweed grows in numerous
groupings near the walls.  The wall to the east has collapsed, but the rubble
still impedes movement in that direction.  The ceiling is still intact but
looks ready to collapse at any moment.  Hanging from the southern wall you can
see six rusted metal hooks, made once for holding large pieces of meat. In the
middle of the shop there is a large stone block, riddled with cracks.  The only
exit you can see is to return to the street back to the north.

The carving is a simple picture of a jumping dolphin while in the background
there is a large knife.  The dolphin's form is simple and the carving as a
whole is rather crude.  The water has begun to wash away at the carving, doing
nothing to enhance its simple image.
~
E block~
The block was probably once made for cutting meat and killing smaller animals
that were kept alive in the butchery. It is made from a hard, sturdy stone
that is a dark grey color.  Small cracks have begun to appear around the edges
of the block and it flakes off quite readily if you touch its surface.  A
simple carving adorns the top of the block, barely legible.  Strangely it is
completely devoid of any barnacles or undersea mosses, a macabre reminder of
what its past purpose was.

condition and the ceiling has already partially collapsed, covering the
northern part of the floor.  Some arcane symbols are carved upon walls, many
of which have faded into almost nothing.  The strangest part of the building
is there is a piece of glass stuck in the middle of the floor.  You can see
no other exits except to return to the street to the south.

The strange symbols are carved all around the walls of the dilapidated
building.  In places they have eroded away, while in others they are still

seen or heard of any language such as this.  The jagged script seems to have
been carved with power or anger because the carvings are very deep into the
stone.

The water here has taken up a slight reddish hue to it for all the rust
particles floating in it.  You see that you have entered the abandoned
blacksmith, although very little remains.  Even the anvils have been reduced
to small clumps of rust and almost nothing remains of the metalworks that once
inhabited this building. The ceiling looks ready to collapse at any second, and
the silt-covered floor has large cracks in it. Few fish swim through here and
seaweed struggles to survive.  The only way that you can tell is safe to exit
the former blacksmith is to the north, back to the street.

It is impossible to tell what this building once held or what its purpose was.
The northern wall has collapsed outwards, but the accumulation of silt and

ceiling has collapsed, littering the floor with chunks of stone.  Cracks
mar every surface that you can see, and even the shards of rock seem ready
to collapse upon themselves.  However, seaweed grows abundantly through the
cracks, swaying slightly with the currents. It may be prudent to return to the

the edges of each of the columns but they seem quite sturdy and still perform
well at the job they were made to do.
~
E statues~
The statues that grace the tops of the buttresses are generally ones of
chalices or jumping dolphins.  From what you can see at this distance all are
very beautiful and have resisted the punishments of the eroding water quite
well.  Several, however, have crumbled into piles of broken stone and still
others are missing parts of themselves.
~
E architecture~
The beautiful architecture of the stone building is breathtaking in both its
beauty and detail.  About eight stone buttresses come off of the main stone
walls, but you can tell that a building of this size would have no use of them.
Instead they are topped with beautiful statues and covered with simple yet
glorious murals.  Two magnificent but simple columns provide support for the
stone roof.  All of the wondrous architecture has survived the punishment of
the eroding water well, but in places you can see it has begun to break down.
~
E sigil sigils~
The two sigils carved upon the heads of the dolphin-handles mean nothing to you
as they are in another language completely.  One of them almost looks like a
small fish, but in places the fins are all wrong.  The other slightly reminds
of you of a flame, but also resembles many other things.  Both sigils are
extremely warm to the touch and seem to hum with an inner strength.
~
E handle handles~
The golden handles upon each of the gate doors allow you to enter the stone
building in front of you.  They are stylized in the form of a jumping dolphin
and are cunningly carved to perfection.  The eyes of the dolphins are
represented with perfectly carved sapphires.  Unfortunately they are firmly
embedded and no amount of strength will pull them free.  A shaft of platinum
fastens each handle to the door tightly.  A small sigil has been carved on
top of each of the dolphin's head and seems to represent something important.
~
E carvings~
Upon each of the seals there are elaborate carvings that seem to glow with a
soft golden light.  The carvings show a large jewelled chalice coming from a
hole in the ground.  From the mouth of the chalice a sleek dolphin jumps into
the air, a glorious sunburst in the background.  Throngs of people seem to be
cheering on the entire ordeal and you can see a small city in the background.
Around the border of the picture there are small carvings of coins.  All of the
carvings are extremely detailed, but you find it odd that they have not washed
away after centuries underwater.
~
E words center~
The three words near the center of the gates are painted with a glossy golden
paint.  They are written in a flowing hand that connects one letter with the
next.  The three words read:

                        "Ministry of Trade"

~
E pictures paint enameled~
The golden paint covers the platinum gates and are extremely well-drawn
pictures of dolphins jumping from a blazing gold chalice that is encrusted with
jewels.  The paint tastefully matches the silver color of the platinum and
covers the entire front of the gates.  Waves, leaves and singing birds are
other, less prominent pictures that serve as the borders and corners of the
large, golden painting.  Near the center of the gates there are three words
painted.
~
E seal seals~
The two large seals are exactly the same image and are bolted onto each of the
gate doors.  Each seal lets off a soft golden glow and is very cool to the
touch.  The bolts that hold the two seals in place are cunningly carved as to
look like small gems embedded into the pure gold.  Beautiful carvings cover
the entire front of the signets and seem to represent something very important.
~
E gate gates~
The large platinum gates are certainly magnificent enough to grace the entrance
of a king's palace.  A large golden seal, covered with carvings are bolted onto
each gate door.  Numerous pictures are enameled in a golden paint and cover the
platinum gates.  Two large strips of steel provide support and strengthen the
gates against any sorts of unwanted incursions.  Each gate is bordered with
titanium, complimenting the color of the platinum well.  Two golden handles
allow for entrance into the small palace and you can see two small sigils
carved onto the front of each.  The gate is in surprisingly excellent condition
as the glossy golden paint shows no signs of wearing away and the detailed
carvings have not started to wash away at all.

End of a Side Street~
The street comes to an end here at the rusted door of a small building that
is partially connected with the battlements.  To your north you can see the
very edge of a domed building but there does not seem to be any entrance to it
here.  To your south you can see a massive structure that is lavishly carved
and decorated; you cannot see an entrance to that building either.  The
building to your east is quite plain but is in the best shape that you have
seen any structure so far.  The cracked street leads to the east.

The Entrance to the Ruined Barracks~
The narrow hallway is decorated only with a carving of two crossed swords on
a background of a clenched fist.  The enclosed walls would only allow the
girth of one man at a time, making this an excellent place to defend.  The
walls are riddled with small cracks, and small chips of rock flake off as you
run your fingers along its surface.  Small alcoves mark where the sconces
once were, but the torches have long since rotted away.  Barnacles have
attached themselves to the walls, giving them a pebbly appearance.  A metal
door allows you to return to the street, or you can go further into the
structure to the south.

This room seems to have been made for meetings, for there is the remains
of a stone podium on the eastern side of the room with eroded benches taking
up the middle.  A carving of two swords crossed on the backdrop of a clenched
fist is behind the podium.  Streaks of light enter through large holes in the
ceiling, giving the room a strangely lit appearance.  Several fish swim slowly
through here, but take absolutely no notice of you.  You can go towards the
entrance of the ruined barracks to the north, or you can delve further into the
abandoned ruins to the west.

Within the Ruined Barracks~
This room once held many weapons and pieces of armor, however, most have rusted
away and the ones that remain are nothing more than twisted pieces of rust.
The walls are lined with carved spaces shaped for a diverse quantity of weapons
and armors.  A long but thin crack splits the room in two, and places it on two
slightly different levels.  Very little seaweed grows here as the water is
polluted with the particles of rust from the weapons.  The rectangular shape of
a door frame is on both the northern and western walls, both leading to more
dilapidated rooms of the former barracks.

room.  Several of the shelves have fallen from where they were carved, leaving
holes in the walls.  A bluish-green seaweed grows from cracks in the floor and
several small fish dart amongst the pieces of stone on the floor.  To your west

nestled in the piles of stone. The piles of rock to your north and west block
any movement in those directions.  You think you can make your way around a
pile of stones to your south or you can enter another room to your east.

The room you enter is as in a shoddy state as the others you have seen, small
piles of rocks litter the ground and streams of light flood in through the
holes.  Six large tables accompanied by two benches each take up most of the
space.  On the south side of the room there is a large alcove carved, probably
the fire pit for the barrack's dining hall. Bluish-green seaweed grows
everywhere in the room and a tan kelp floats with the currents.  Small fish and
other sea life have made this room their home and for the most part ignore you.
You think you can make your way around a pile of rocks to the north or leave

Entrance to the Ministry of Magic~
The room that you have entered is strangely still filled with wooden furniture.
Plush chairs and an elaborately carved table line the eastern wall and a
painting with a menagerie of colors graces the western wall.  The quality of
this room compared to others that you have seen is almost impossible, hardly
a scratch mars the walls, the ceiling is completely intact and the floor is
clean of silt and seaweed.  A strange stone sculpture sits in the middle of
the room, letting off a slight glow that provides light.  You can see the
carved outline of a door to your south, but there doesn't seem to be any way to
open it.  To your north you see a shimmering portal that reveals nothing of the
next room.

The stone sculpture that is in the center of the floor is certainly strange and
does not seem to represent anything in particular.  Your eyes seem to catch
the figures of robed people and jumping dolphins, but when you focus upon the
area all you can see is the flowing carved stone.  The stone lets off a soft
green glow that is pleasant to the eyes and allows you to see in the otherwise
dark room.  The sculpture is held up by a pedestal of the same material that
is carved in the image of a jumping dolphin.
~
E painting~
The painting is a strange menagerie of colors that almost seems to represent
human forms with arms stretched into the air.  You can swear that the colors
seem to change slightly every so often, and the figures move with actions of
real people.  The painting is bordered with swimming dolphins and hands that
are outlined with a splash of water.  The wooden frame is carved in the images
of a kind of flower that you do not recognize.
~
E chairs table~
The chairs and table are certainly an anomaly for they have not rotted away
after being underwater for centuries.  The two chairs are carved with almost
inhuman detail of dolphins flying through the clouds and goblets pouring gold
coins into an outstretched hand.  The plush cushion is embroidered with leaping
dolphins and strange orange flowers.  The table is quite small, and its top
is completely smooth.  Its legs however are covered with carvings of leaping
dolphins, a hand outlined in a splash of water and a goblet that is completely
full of gold coins.
~
#20158
Within the Ministry of Magic~
This room is in excellent condition and strangely enough contains wooden
furniture.  A large plush couch sits at the west wall and there is a wooden
chair that leans against the eastern wall.  A large painting sits above the
chair and takes up most of that wall.  The ceiling, unlike many buildings
that you have seen so far, has not fallen in, and the rest of the room looks
perfectly normal except that it is filled with water.  A soft glow fills the
entire room, but you cannot see where it originates from.  A soft rug floats
a few inches off the floor and moves slightly with the currents.  There is a
small sign on the northern wall slides ever so slightly with the currents.
There is a majestic-looking door to your north and a shimmering portal to your
south.

The rug is woven tightly with thin threads of varying colors.  Whoever made
this was truly a master, the repeating pattern of a three-petaled flower
around the border almost seem to be real.  Strangely enough, the rug has not
rotted away in the water and seems to be in perfect condition.  The most
amazing part of all, however, is the center of the rug which swirls with
colors and seems to change before your eyes.
~
E sign~
The sign is made from a strange wood, but your hand seems to pass through it
if you try and remove the sign.  The message is written in a flowing script
and reads:

                Do not interrupt the Master of the Art
                unless in dire emergency.  If you do
                interrupt the Master without his
                consent, the punishment will be dire
                indeed towards your station of power.

~
E painting~
The painting is quite large and takes up the entire eastern wall.  It depicts
a man slowly changing into the form of a grey dolphin and fighting off a large
group of sharks before returning to his original shape.  It is painted in
extreme detail and you almost feel compelled to reach out and touch to see if
the man inside is really alive.  The frame is carved beautifully with jumping
dolphins and hands outlined with a splash of water.
~
E couch chair~
The plush couch is a pleasant purple color and looks very comfortable to sit
in.  It is embroidered with tiny flowers and jumping dolphins.  The chair is
made from a wood that feels quite strange, as if it is not quite real.  It is
completely plain except that its legs are each carved beautifully with images
of jumping dolphins.

in perfect condition, not at all affected by the water.  Three large tables
take up most of the room and a large basin is on the western wall.  A beautiful
painting is hung above the basin but does not seem to sway with the water as
it should.  Near the eastern wall there is a small table and chair, obviously
made for writing.  A soft glow fills the room, but you cannot tell where it
comes from.  To your north you can see a sturdy-looking wooden door with a
large dolphin carved near the top.  To your south you can see a shimmering
portal that gives no clue to where it leads.

The small painting is an exquisite representation of a dolphin swimming near

to make the dolphin more distinct than the rest of the painting and much larger
in proportion than a dolphin truly is.  The frame is carved in the likeness of
small dolphins chasing a ship which in turn is chasing another dolphin and so
on.

E tables chair table~
The three large tables are very sturdy and are made from an unknown wood.  They
have absolutely no markings upon them except for several small pits in them
and a couple of scorch marks that should have washed away after being in the
water for so long.  The small table and chair on the eastern wall look as
though they were made for writing.  The table is exceptionally smooth, and the
legs are carved in the images of sea serpents with their mouths opened wide.
The chair is made from the same material as the table and is carved with small
images of leaping dolphins and outstretched hands receiving a splash of water.
The chair's cushion is embroidered in the image of a large dolphin jumping into
the clouds.
~
E basin~
The wooden basin is quite large and you think that a gnome could stretch out
fully inside.  Absolutely no carvings are to be seen upon the entire basin and
for the most part it feels as smooth as the water around it.  Small scorch
marks mar the inside of the basin and for a moment you wonder why the water
has not washed them away.  You think that the basin resembles the large mixing
bowls that certain mages use to prepare potions.

of varying colors and shapes.  Small cracks have begun near each of those
scorch marks, but nothing that would threaten the integrity of the room itself.
A soft glow permeates throughout the entire room, although you cannot pinpoint
where it originates from.  The door that you entered through is the only exit,

mars any of the walls or floor.  The ceiling is completely intact and has a
large picture of a hand with an outline of a splash of water carved into it.
A faint white glow lights the entire room although you cannot tell where it
originates from.  A small note hangs on the western wall of this room and
glows with a bright green light, attracting your eyes to it immediately.

E chest chests~
Each of the dozens of chests are exactly the same in make.  They are primarily
rended from a strange dark-colored wood that seems just right for the shapes
of each of the chests.  Large strips of titanium strengthen each of the chests
and effectively lock them from any prying fingers.  A small square of lead is
on the front of each, seemingly the markings for what each chest holds.  You
have never seen the language that the markings are and you can not even guess
what their meanings are.  Unfortunately, when you try to even touch any of the
chests your hand is barred by an unseen shield.

A truly elegant room meets your eye as you look around here.  The person who

riches that sit before you.  A large painting sits on the northern wall,
truly a masterpiece if you have ever seen one.  A complicated rug sits beneath
your feet, strangely not floating in the water slightly as something of that
material should.  Jewels are embedded into the walls themselves at regular
intervals, making the room sparkle brightly at times.  In the center of the
room there is a large empty spot, as if there should be something there but
it is missing at this time.  A soft glow permeates throughout the entire room,
but you are not sure where it originates from.  The only exit from this room
is to the south, a large wooden door that leads back to the water-filled
waiting room.

The painting must have been created by a master, seeing the detail that is put
into it.  Strangely the paint should have washed away long ago under the water

hands to the sky and meeting a tidal wave with a wall of earth.  Numerous
dolphins jump from the tidal wave and a throng of cheering people wait behind
the robed men.  The frame is carved with the repeating image of a dolphin
chasing a wave.

Within an Empty Building~
You stand in a large, open-domed building that seems to be completely empty
of anything other than sea life and pieces of stone that lies upon the floor.
The ground is covered in loose, deep silt that swirls into the air as the water
currents flow past.  Tall blue-green seaweed grows from the ground, giving the
seascape a greenish color.  The curving wall obstructs movement to your north
and west, and although it seems sturdy it is still filled with holes and
cracks.  You see a small inscription carved into the wall but it is very
difficult to read due to its weathered state.  You can continue further into
the dark shadows to your south and east.

Entrance to the Ministry of Trade~
The room that you are in seems to be in reasonably decent condition and was
probably once beautifully furnished.  The architecture of the room is incredible
in nature, making the flowing walls and ceiling seem beautiful. Nothing remains
in the room anymore, for it must have rotted away long ago under the water.
Deep silt covers the floor and seaweed grows from holes in the walls and ground.
A lavish statue has been carved from the western wall although it has begun to
deteriorate.  The grand gates that lead back to the street lie to you north.
The rectangular spaces of doors that have long rotted away lead to the east and
west.

places.

The marble statue was masterfully carved directly from the wall.  It is the
the image of a jumping dolphin that was quite obviously created by a master
of the craft.  The detail put into the statue is astounding, but unfortunately
the water has begun to take its toll upon it.  Part of the fin has cracked off
and small cracks have begun to appear all over the statue.

Nothing remains inside this room except for the beautiful carvings that grace
the walls.  Whoever used this structure must have been in a high station of
power or very wealthy.  The walls and ceiling have been carved in such a way
that they seem to be flowing waves.  A small statue was carved from the eastern
wall, although now it has almost completely eroded.  Small cracks have begun
to appear in the floor and walls, allowing room for the blue-green seaweed to
grow.  To your south you see the rectangular opening of a door that has long
rotted away. The same also lies to you east, although it is much bigger than

The carvings on the wall were once quite beautiful, but unfortunately many

its own tail borders everything upon the walls.

A small statue was carved from the eastern wall of this room, but now almost
all of its features have been washed away by water.  You think that it is in
the figure of a human, but absolutely no features remain that would help

rather a softer and most likely cheaper material, probably the reason that it
has eroded to this degree.

collapsed, allowing the strangely refracted light to illuminate the room.
The southern wall has for the most part collapsed, impeding movement in that
direction.  The northern wall has survived whatever destroyed this room, but
it still is riddled with cracks and holes.  Stalks of blue-green seaweed grow
wildly here, and a large concentration grows on the western wall, giving it a
strange appearance.  The only exit is the empty door frame that leads eastwards

grows with unbridled vigor, making it difficult to see very clearly.  The water
here is also very murky, most likely from the massive amounts of seaweed and
the fact that the walls are falling apart.  To your west you can see a room in

that they look like a certain cheese that you have seen throughout Shalar.  You
cannot move very far into the room because the large pile of broken marble
impedes any movement.  The blue-green seaweed is very plentiful here, giving

seaweed and hundreds of small barnacles.  You can feel the sturdy wall of the
battlements to your west and the marble pieces of collapsed building everywhere
else around you.  The only visible exit from the small grotto is to your east,

peek through the floor, mainly because there aren't any cracks to grow from.

On each side of the corridor there is a large carving, it has begun to erode
but you think that you can still make it out.   Several holes in the ceiling
provides a dim light that you can see by.  The corridor leads north to a large

Nothing remains upon the inside of this building other than the rubble of from
the walls and the ceiling.  There is little room to move around here because
of the piles of stone that cover the floor.  The stone that this structure was
made of is greyish and plain.  The ceiling has fallen in at parts, allowing
shafts of greenish light that give the room some illumination.  The eastern and
western walls have both partially fallen in, covering the floor with pieces of
stone.  The turquoise seaweed that you have seen much of in the ruins grows

You stand in a large room that was probably an ante-chamber when this
structure was still inhabited.  The marble walls have survived the erosion of
years of being underwater well.  A few small holes in the ceiling allow for
some light to enter the room, permitting a dim illumination. Blue-green seaweed
grows from the cracks in the floor and green kelp floats near the ceiling.  A
large sigil is carved into the floor, eroded slightly but still legible.  The
large golden gates that exit back to the street are to you west.  Empty door
frames lead further into the building to your north, south and east.

                The council of eight shall go to the sea.--

~
E sigil~
The large sigil is in the shape of eight dolphins swimming towards a gleaming
jewel in the center of the carving.  On the outside there is the continuing
image of dolphins chasing strange three-petaled flowers.  There is a writing
near the center of the carving, eroded slightly by the water but still legible.

You float in a small room that seems to have survived the punishment of the
sea quite well.  The entire room is made from a white marble that appears
slightly greenish under the water.  Several cracks mar the floor and holes
in the ceiling provide a feeble lighting for the room.  A thin layer of silt
covers the floor, moving slight as you displace the water near it.  Several
stalks of a blue-green seaweed grow from the cracks in the floor, swaying
slightly as the underwater currents flow by.  The only exit from this small
room is back to the south where you can see a large stone room.

This room that you are in seems to have not survived years underneath the sea
very well.  Most of the ceiling has collapsed, covering the floor with broken
pieces of stone and providing a dim green illumination.  The walls have
numerous cracks and pits in them, but none that would be serious enough to be
wary of their collapse.  The room is quite small, and is made from a white
marble that seems quite sturdy.  The blue-green seaweed grows abundantly here,
swaying like trees in the wind with the currents.  The only exit from this room
is to return through the empty door frame to your north.

You are in a large expansive room that has partially collapsed in several
areas.  In parts the ceiling has fallen in, allowing dim green light to
illuminate the room.  The walls have partially collapsed in parts, littering
the floor with piles of broken marble.  The turquoise seaweed that you  have
seen much of in the city grows wildly here, resembling a small underwater
forest.   To the north you can see a small room that has partially collapsed.
A long corridor progresses southward into the darkness. To the east you can see
a large rusted metal door that does not seem to be locked. The entrance to
this building lies back to the west through an empty door frame.

                or a special guest of one of the eight.--

~
E sigil~
The sigil is a large gold-plated circle that is upon the rusted metal door.
It has been carved in the image of a dolphin jumping upon the backdrop of a
fist clenching a cup overflowing with coins.  Several dents mar the carving
and it has begun to erode slightly.  A small script has been carved upon the
circle beneath the picture.
~
E door rusted~
The rusted door to your east would be quite sturdy except that it has been
substantially weakened by rust.  It is most likely made of iron due to the
magnitude that it has rusted.  The door appears completely plain now, but there
might be carvings that have been covered up by the rust.  A large golden sigil
is embedded into the door and seems to have survived the ravages of the water.

In a Hallway~
You stand in a tight hallway that does not allow you to swim, rather you must
slowly walk on the floor.  The marble walls seem to have survived centuries
underwater quite well for only several cracks mar its surface.  There is a thin
layer of silt beneath your feet which swirls into small clouds of dust as you
walk by.  Looking at the walls there seems to be a repeating carving that
continues to the south.  The darkness of the hallway seems to swallow you and
you are forced to rely on whatever you can to lead you.  The long corridor
leads back to the large ante-chamber to the north or you can delve deeper into

You stand in a tight hallway that does not allow you to swim, rather you must
slowly walk on the floor.  The marble walls seem to have survived centuries
underwater quite well for only several cracks mar its surface.  There is a thin
layer of silt beneath your feet which swirls into small clouds of dust as you
walk by.  Looking at the walls there seems to be a repeating carving that
continues to the south.  The darkness of the hallway seems to swallow you and
you are forced to rely on whatever you can to lead you.  Empty door frames lead
into small stone rooms to your east and west.  The long corridor continues to

The large hole in the ceiling allows the light to flood into the room, allowing

The seal is a large golden circle that is upon the set of rusted metal doors.
It is covered with elaborate carvings of dolphins jumping into a sunburst that
is overhead an outstretched hand.  A cup or chalice that is overflowing with
coins is the repeating border of the circle.  Outside the border there are
eight small starburst, each with a small glyph inside, although none of them
mean anything to you.  Carved in a flowery script there is a message written
near the bottom of the seal.

You stand in a vast room made from pure white marble. The ceiling has numerous
cracks in it and a few holes that provide a dim illumination.  In the center of
the room there is an enormous table made from the same white marble as the
walls.  The table is in the shape of a circle and three fire giants lay down
upon it with space to spare.  Eight low marble benches were carved from the
floor adjacent to the table at periodic locations.  A thin layer of silt covers
the floor and swirls into the air as the underwater currents flow by.  The only
exit from this room is the large metal doors to your west that lead back to the

Each bench has a strange sigil etched into its surface.  Either they are in a
language you have never seen or they represent something you do not understand.
Either way you cannot comprehend any of them for what they mean.  The sigils
vary in shape and tend to overlapping lines that create a strange image that
slightly resembles the web of a spider.  Strangely the sigils have not begun
to erode due to the water, even though they are lightly carved into the stone.
~
E table bench benches~
The table in the center of the room is absolutely gigantic, one of the larger
pieces of furniture that you have seen in your life.  It is in a circular shape
and is made from the same white marble as the walls.  A few cracks mar the
smooth surface of the table, but nothing that would seriously threaten its
structural integrity.  The low benches are made from the same white marble and
all eight are carved from the floor at periodic locations at the table.  Each
bears a strange sigil that makes no sense to you whatsoever.

covered with a thin layer of silt that swirls into small clouds as the swift,
cold currents flow by.  Turquoise seaweed grows abundantly here and sways
slightly as the currents rush by.  The only exit from this room is to return

E statue~
The statue is of a dolphin jumping from a large chalice that is overflowing
with coins.  Although slightly eroded from years under the sea you can still
tell that whoever carved this was truly a master.  The dolphin's eyes almost
seem to sparkle with intelligence but it must be a trick of the water.  The
chalice overflowing with coins serves as the base for the dolphin and has large
gemstones firmly embedded into it.  Any attempts to pull them out are futile
as they are immovably implanted into the stone.

In a Long Corridor~
You stand in a long corridor that forces you to walk in the water instead of
swim because of the low ceiling.  The tight walls of the corridor are made
from the same grey stone as the rest of the building.  A very thin layer of silt
covers the floor and swirls into small clouds as your feet brush by.  A small
carving graces the eastern wall above a small message or prayer also carved.
A soft gold glow illuminates the entire corridor, but you cannot tell where it
originates from.  The long corridor leads north back to the large room and
further to the south turns to the west, leading further into the abandoned
temple.

E prayer message~
The message is carved in a flowing script that glows slightly.  It reads:

                --And so the enemies were pushed back by the
                faith of Tcar.  If we do not lose faith in him
                we will not lose ourselves, by this we pray.--

~
E carving~
The carving seems rather to be a small mural that depicts a large scene of
a dozen dolphins each outlined by a sunburst, fighting off a large host
of bloodthirsty sharks and pirates.  In the background you can see a muscled
fist clenching a large chalice with a dolphin jumping out.  Although slightly
eroded from the water, the mural is incredibly detailed and you can tell that
a true master of the craft carved it.  A small message or prayer is carved
beneath the mural.

#20244
End of a Long Corridor~
The long corridor ends here as part of the temple has collapsed, burying most
of the corridor and the rest of the building.  The grey walls of the corridor
are riddled with cracks and seem ready to collapse at any moment.  The ceiling
has partially collapsed, allowing a dim, green illumination to light the room.
A thick layer of silt covers the floor and swirls into the water as the undersea
currents flow by.  Looking up you can see the rest of the sea, but none of the
holes are big enough to allow a humanoid through.  Several stalks of the
turquoise seaweed grow from the unnatural wall to your west.  The only exit
from this room is to turn back and continue down the corridor to the east.

The altar is quite small, no bigger than a small child.  It is connected to the
north-western corner and glows with an inner light.  The small box is covered
with
gold, but strangely none has eroded from years underneath the sea.  Minuscule
carvings are upon each of the three visible sides.  One side shows a man riding
a dolphin into the sky, another shows a large shark eating a man and the final
one that faces the ceiling is a simple carving of a dolphin outlined by a
sunburst.  Small runes are underneath each of the pictures, but they mean
nothing to you.

In a Small Side Room~
You are forced to stoop in this too-small room that glows extremely bright.
The walls are made from the same grey stone that the rest of the temple is
rended from.  The bright green light coupled with the water makes your vision
blurry and forces you to squint.  Upon the floor there is an elaborate carving
with a small circle in the middle, room enough for you to sit cross-legged.
The thin layer of silt upon the floor swirls into the air as your feet brush by,
obscuring your vision even more.  The only exit from this room is to return to
the main chamber back to your south.

carved directly from the floor, forming a rough circle around a simple carving.
Upon each of the benches there is a small message etched.  Looking up at the
ceiling you can see the identical carving that you see upon the floor inside
the circle of benches.  The only exit from this room is to return to the main

flowing script that is in a language that you have never seen or heard of.
The benches are cool to the touch and almost seem to hum with an inner power.
~
E carving~
Upon both the floor and the ceiling there is a simple picture carved.  A
perfect circle is the outside of the picture, big enough so that you could
sit upon it cross-legged.  Inside the circle there is a simple carving of a
dolphin jumping out of a chalice that is overflowing with coins.

In a Dark Corridor~
You are in a dark corridor that is within the area of the temple that appeared
to have collapsed.  It seems that instead of collapsing upon itself the temple
actually fell into a small sinkhole.  Whatever magic that provided the glow
of light in the other part of the temple has apparently failed here as the inky
blackness of the watery depths engulfs you.  The seaweed has been replaced by a
dark-green moss that grows upon the walls and fallen stones.  The corridor takes
a turn to the south, leading into the darkness.  An empty door frame leads
westwards to another room and the pile of rubble that you crawled under is back
to your east.

reach of the light.  The broken pieces of stone beneath you are covered with a
dark green sea moss that flakes off quite readily if touched.  You are quite
certain that the large room extends to your west and south.

A dark-green undersea moss grows in the pitch black of the ruined temple.
Generally it grows upon pieces of stone that have fallen from the walls
or ceiling.  The moss is  coarse to the touch but flakes off quite
readily if you push too hard. The blind albino fish seem to rely upon
the moss for sustenance when they chance to find it.

Within the Altar Room~
You float within the large room which was the destination of the spiraling
corridor.  The room is made of the same grey stone that the rest of the temple
was, but here it seems to exude an aura of peace and tranquility.  The walls
are covered with carvings and strange writings of a language that you have
never seen.  Upon the floor there is a large carving of a sunburst, with a
small circle that is big enough for you to sit cross-legged in.  The walls
are completely clear of any cracks or holes and the entire room seems to be
in perfect condition.  Sitting near the north wall is the reason that this
room is lit with a golden glow, a large and beautiful altar blazes with light
and seems to emit a feeling of joy and love into you.  The only exit from this
beautiful room is back to the spiraling corridor to your south.

trapdoor~
Looking at the hair-thin line, you begin to suspect that there is a trapdoor
upon the floor.  Sure enough, there is a thin finger hold where you can pull
up the relatively light block of stone that serves as the door to a lower
level.  Even the hinges are masked with expert carving as to appear to be part
of the floor.

E floor sunburst~
Upon the floor there is a masterful carving of a sunburst with an outline of
tiny dolphins chasing each other.  Inside the sunburst there is a small circle
devoid of any carvings, big enough for you to sit cross-legged onto it.  The
largest ray of the sunburst points towards the glowing altar upon the northern
wall.  You notice a hair-thin line in the shape of a perfect square upon the
floor, easily mistaken for the different blocks of stone that make up the floor.
~
E carving carvings walls~
The carvings cover the entire room except for the floor and parts of the
ceiling.  They vary heavily in their design but all seem to include a chalice
overflowing with coins and a jumping dolphin in some way.  In one carving you
can see a large ship carried by a dolphin into the skies with a wine glass
overflowing with coins in the background.  In another there is a small city
on top of the wine glass overflowing with coins with a dolphin in the
background.  You could spend literally weeks looking at each of the extremely
detailed carvings that grace the walls of this room.
~
#20272
Below the Altar~
You float in a dark room which is cramped and dark, it appears to have been
once carved in the shape of a perfect cube.  The walls are completely blank,
made of a cool grey stone that is coarse to the touch and is as unyielding and
strong as the mountains of the North.  A small layer of silt has begun to form
upon the ground and swirls into tiny clouds as you float past.  You assume
that this was a room to place the sacrifices to the altar, a storage room or
perhaps to hide something very important.  Upon the western wall, there is a
small alcove carved, quite cleverly as it is not very easily noticed.  To the
north, the perfect wall has been destroyed by some incredible force, creating
a rough tunnel that continues into the utter darkness.  The hidden door above
you beckons back to the brightly lit room of the altar.

E carving~
Within the carved alcove you can barely see the tiny carving of a jumping
dolphin, its tail loosely gripped by a disembodied hand.  Tongues of fire leap
from the body of the dolphin and rays of radiance are carved outwards in a
sign of importance and glory.  A small repeating floral carving outlines the
entire picture, it seems to be of a three-leaved plant that flowers with gems
and precious jewels.
~
E alcove~
The alcove is carved in such a way that the darkness of the room hides it in
its own shadows, making it initially difficult to spot.  The edges of the
alcove are perfect but quite simple, as if something of no great importance
was stored here.  The shape of the alcove seems to suggest that at one point
it held a sword, but you have never seen a sword like this.  You can identify
where the grip and hilt was, but the blade appears to be in the shape of a
wave or perhaps a fish of some sort.  In the middle of the carved alcove, you
can see a tiny carving, barely visible.
~
#20273
The End of the Tunnel~
The rough tunnel stops here, widening into a larger room and relieving the
feeling of claustrophobia.  This room appears to have been rended in the same
manner as the tunnel, through a massive destructive force of some kind.  The
room is still littered with small pieces of rock and the water is extremely
murky due to the large amount of dust.  Nothing grows here at all, in fact you
can see the bones of dozens of fish upon the ground, many of them horribly
mangled and destroyed.  The ceiling is roughly rounded into the walls, creating
a sense of vertigo as you cannot truly tell which way is up while in the water.
Upon the western wall, you see a perfect steel door, easily standing out against
the rough walls.  To the south the rough tunnel leads back to the small room
beneath the altar.

A Rough-Walled Side Room~
This tiny side room is in the general shape of a sphere, the ceiling and walls
do not exist, creating a profound sense of misdirection within you.  The room
seems to have been rended from the rock with pure force as the sides are
extremely rough and pieces of stone still lie about.  The room is quite small,
and combined with its round shape, you feel extremely uncomfortable while in
here.  The small blasted chamber is completely bare of any sea life or fauna,
only the shadows seem to dance in the back of your head and your mind reels
constantly, making it hard to think.  A large ornate chest is partially melded
with the stone in the middle of the rounded floor, a large platinum padlock
protecting it from prying hands.  The steel door to your east stands out in
plain contrast to the rough walls, leading to the large rough-walled room.
