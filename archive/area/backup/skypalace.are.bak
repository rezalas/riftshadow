A freakishly thin spirit prances about, trailed by ribbons.

Oddly youthful and whisper thin, this elemental spirit runs, dances and
twirls through the palace.  Its ethereal form is a pale shade of blue,
mottled with specks of a brighter and more solid blue that swirl around
within its 'body.  '

a dreameater~
A dark gnome-like creature floats upside-down, swathed in stars.
~
Like some sort of twisted combination of a gnome and illythid, this
slimy, dark blue-skinned creature hangs upside-down from the ceiling
grinning maniacally.  Though it is completely nude, it has no signs of
gender or muscle... the entire surface of its skin is slick, round and
slimy, not unlike the back of a frog.

a bleeding shade~
A terribly disfigured man is here, bleeding black blood from every orifice.
~
The translucent face of this shade is stained with an unchanging
expression of sorrow and intangible blood.  The shade appears to have been a
dark-skinned man at one point.  His cheekbones are high and strong and his
nose is somewhat flattened.  His eyes are sunken back into his head and
appear completely black, a hint of light glinting off of the ever-flowing
blood streaming out from every cavity.  A vague, weeping sound echoes
through the air around it, mixing with a disgustingly choked gurgling noise,
but the sound's source does not seem to be definite.  The torn arms and legs
are blurred, so that the shade seems to be floating.

dummy mob~
A dummy mob is standing here.
~
A foul air steams from the moist, shivering flesh of this giant, snarling vaguely
humanoid creature.  Three rows of tiny, sharp teeth chatter within its maw and its 
breathing is tortured and choked.  Its huge, muscular arms support some of its weight,
but its long, sinewy legs seem to be capable of propelling it forward quite easily.
Its throat is hidden beneath thick muscle, so that the creature appears to have no neck
at all.  Pale pinpoints of white light shine from within its corrupted ocular cavities, 
devoid of emotion or imagination.

Perfectly cut and smooth walls form this wide and long square corridor,
allowing the minute sound of dripping water and the howl of wind to bounce
around and almost overwhelm those here to hear it.  One can make out vague
whispers and cries as well, but it may simply be the wind.  The corridor
continues to the north, the source of a slight breeze, and to the south,
into a small room, and eventually the outside.

Vendurre's Maw~
The corridor widens into a rounded chamber, where wind reverberates into
a booming howl.  A grand archway opens to the north, terrible in its ruined
splendor.  Moss-eaten carvings of ancient numbers and astrological signs
line the maw -- mere relics of a culture lost to the very spirit it
worshipped.  Beyond, a vast, musty hall opens up.  Rays of natural light
within streak down from the ceiling but are half-devoured by the dust in the
air.  The far side of the chamber is not visible from here because of the
musty haze.

A Vast, Musty Hall~
This massive rectangular room is floored with patterned tiles of royal
blue and crimson marble.  The walls are of polished hematite, giving a
surreal feeling to this main chamber.  Blue-flamed torches line the walls
around top of the room high above you, their light reflecting off of the
hematite and filling the room with a dense bluish hue when the natural light
from the sun fades.  The floor is ledge-like, in that it is only about ten
feet wide before it drops out the bottom of the island into the realm below.
Clouds, trees and water are all far, far beneath this palace, but the wind
gusting up through the large gaps in the floor serve as a reminder as to how
real they are.  In the center of this mid-air abyss rests a large platform
with a strange sort of structure resting in its center.

blue and crimson marble.  The walls are of polished hematite, giving a
surreal feeling to this main chamber.  Blue-flamed torches line the walls
around top of the room high above you, their light reflecting off of the
hematite and filling the room with a dense bluish hue when the natural light
from the sun fades.  The floor is ledge-like, in that it is only about ten
feet wide before it drops out the bottom of the island into the realm below.
Clouds, trees and water are all far, far beneath this palace, but the wind
gusting up through the large gaps in the floor serve as a reminder as to how
real they are.  In the center of this mid-air abyss rests a large platform
with a strange sort of structure resting in its center.

A Steel Bridge~
Only about five feet wide, this bridge is sturdy yet a bit unsettling. 
The floor is grated, so that the realm below you is in almost full view
should you choose to look directly down.  Wind gusts upward occasionally,
and with each step, the bridge seems to clatter slightly, though it doesn't
budge.  To the north, a platform sits in the center of this room.  The
bridges seem to be the only things connecting it to the main structure of
the Palace.

The Center of Time~
Large, strategically placed windows set into the southern ceiling allow
natural light to shine down upon a massive clock on this platform.  A wide
circle of tiles that runs around the outside of the clock has a staggering
amount of small words, symbols and angles drawn upon it.  All of these
characters are etched in gold, to serve the purpose of both decoration and
utility.  Empty air surrounds most of this platform, save the bridges that
connect it to the Palace.  High up above you, you can see a thin line that
distorts the light just slightly as well as the apparent beginnings of a
hallway set into the top of the northern wall.  There is no obvious way to
get up to it, however.  Bridges lead off in the four cardinal directions
across the open air.

 Moonlight permeates the air, setting the giant clock aglow.  Shadows form
black, liquid shapes within the inner-workings of the clock continually
shift and change.  Strange glyphs seem to have been carved into the glass
face of the clock.  They glow brightly in the night air.  The moonlight
seems to be entering the Palace through a series of large windows in the
southern ceiling.  A wide circle of tiles around the outside of the clock
has a staggering amount of small words, symbols and angles drawn upon it. 
All of these characters are etched in gold, to serve the purpose of both

bridges that connect it to the Palace.  High above, a translucent
milky-white plane seems to span across mid-air, leading to a faint

four cardinal directions across a chillingly deep and dark abyss, granting
access to the shadowy perimeter of the hall.

walkway that spans across the top of the Palace.  A spot high up in the

blue trailing behind it as it begins its journey across the sky.  On the

beneath the horizon, retreating from the sun's light.  Shining black tiles
line the floor beneath you, plain but beautiful and obviously costly.  They
continue down this hallway, to the north.

The walls, floor and ceiling of this room are pitch-black.  Not even the
corners are perfectly visible, and the fact that there is no visible horizon
makes this place rather disorienting.  Perhaps it is the lack of visual
stimuli, but a high-pitched ringing is barely audible.

TRAP 'poison dart' 8 10 3
A glyph flashes before your eyes, revealing a series of tiny holes in the walls before it fades.~
A quiet hiss is the only harbinger of a deadly, poisonous dart!~

An Ancient Archival Chamber~
This room is rather small, and the texts housed within it are obviously
in poor condition.  Cracked plaster and marble blanket the ground, along
with a thick layer of dust.  Shelves cover all of the walls, housing rotting
books.

| -         `V|  -  Pronounced: "Fah' re nah'"
| -         The glyph that symbolizes the ultimate blessing of Berus,
| -         who watches us from the sky.  Once our period in this valley is
| -         through, which it presumably is should any but our own be reading
| -         this, we will be gently released to the place of which we dream, 
| -         to live as gods and kings in peace.  It is, in essence, our future.
| - 
| -         '[]  -  Pronounced: "Kreh' no"
| -         The glyph that symbolizes our state of protection that Calabren provides
| -         before Berus will bestow her blessing upon us.  As I write, this state is
| -         in effect.  It is our present and past.
| -
 
We, the Vendurre, treasure both, but it is what the future holds that empowers us.
 
The present, as pleasant as it may be, only plagues us with war.  For posterity,
and to enlighten you unto our way of living, a relic of the protection we live
under is locked away within our Grand Palace to the sibling Moons.  
 
May you find it within our dream of the future, beyond the darkness of sleep, and may 
it inspire you to join us.

A throng of old gnarled everygreens stand like silent sentries all around
you.  Dried brown needles fallen from the trees above blanket the ground
like a freshly fallen snow.  The dusty trail composed of a light brown dirt
winds throughout the thickly forested mountains.  The perpetual howling of
the wind through the trees makes it seem as if the trees themselves were
screaming in terror.  An occasional bird flaps through the air, only to land
and sing for a small time before flying out of sight.  The wind blows a
thick mist from the waterfall to the south up against the inner side of the
mountain, just off to the north.
