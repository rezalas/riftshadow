a minotaur hiker~
A hiking minotaur is walking along the trail.
~
A large minotaur is before you garbed with animal furs from the waist
down.  His upper body remains unclothed yet a cape is fastened around his
neck to protect himself against the harsh climates of the mountain. 
Carrying a walking stick, he continues his journey along the pass with
occasional grunts.

A minotaur with the duty of sentry guards the trail.
~
This creature makes no movement to acknowledge your presence as he trains
his vigilence upon the nearby surroundings.  Clothed in untreated leather
and pelts of animal fur, he barely wears any other pieces of protective
armor.  A constant sneer seems to make up his bovine face as if he would
prefer to be anywhere else but upon this mountain pass on watch.

A minotaur travels along the forest trail during his pilgrimage.
~
This minotaur barely lifts his gaze from the ground as he treks along the
forest path.  His clothing is made up of a simple robe with no extra type of
adornments to mark his frame.  Despite his passive looks, it is obvious to
note his well seasoned muscles as though he has gone through some type of
training of combat arts within his religion.  Making not a sound, he
continues along with some greater purpose.

~
This minotaur's body is covered with animal hides and sewn leather that
has been fashioned with crude dexterity.  Strapped to his backside is a
large gnarled staff that appears to be crafted from solid oak despite the
surrounding pine trees.  His movements seem quite fluent in these woodlands
as if he has spent most of his time studying the terrain and ways of the
forest.  A certain compassion seems to lay within his eyes as he rests his
hands upon tree after tree during his sojourn.

This minotaur is fashioned from head to hoof in crude metal pieces that
offer him protection against any beast that might assault the passing
caravans.  If not for two horns and the typical shape of a minotaur's face,
it would be near impossible to know what type of heritage this beast
possesses beneath his full-plated helmet.  He barely seems to move as he
keeps a trained eye upon his surroundings, but now and then you notice him
stamping the ground with his hooves.

by anyone.  The counter to this is that if a neutral or goodie does wear it, when they
sleep, they would receive a "dream" about a succubus seducing them (pg13) and thus
not allowing them to sleep properly, or not allow to waken when they'd like.

This trail appears to be wide enough for several men to easily stand side
by side before the mountain walls begin to rise on each side of the path.

weather, and though many areas of the ground remain uneven, well packed dirt
suggests it is used regularly.

occasional rock and miscellaneous debris can be seen at time to time.  Walls

many forms of wildlife.  The dirt path is smooth from regular use, but some

The deep green hues of the forest can be seen in every direction from the
pine needles of the surrounding trees to the natural hedges that have grown
sporadically through this region.  Thick grass covers the ground, but the
majority of its color is made up of dense moss that has grown underneath.

arms lay folded across the torso portion.  A strange mass of stone sits upon
the location that a head would normally be placed.  Eyes and other forms are
still depicted in the head-like stone, yet its deep ruby color contrasts
dramatically with the lower onyx body, as if symbolizing something more.

clothing seems to be formed of a sleek robe with several artifacts adorning
his belt, carved with perfect detail.  A strange whip is wrapped about the
frame of the statue several times, carved from a vein of granite other than
the surrounding onyx.  Looking back towards the face of the statue, it seems
a bit obnoxious for it to be grining so widely.
