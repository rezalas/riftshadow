wind imp blue creature~
a wind imp~
A tiny blue creature with large, white feathered wings flaps about violently.
~
Smooth yet tough blue skin covers the small body of this odd creature. 
Large, bird-like wings stick out from its back, making it resemble a sort of
grotesque mockery of a cherub.  Its pudgy cheeks nearly engulf its beady
little eyes, and its large bat-like ears continually quiver.  Faint sparks
and arcs of electricity course through its entire body.

a sky devil~
A sleek figure dances through the night air, tendrils of darkness swirling about its frame.
~
Thin and awkwardly shaped, this sinewy demon seems to ride upon the wind
that blows across these plains, even in the absence of wings.  Tusks gouge
out of the sides of its mouth, seeming painful.  Its face has indentations
where its eyes should go, but there are no eyeballs on its face.  Its black
leathery skin is tightly wrapped around its sleek form, and is covered with
squirming white parasites.

This being seems to be a physical and spiritual embodiment of violence. 
Ashes, bones and blood whirl around a glowing green eye.  The stench of
death and decay gust out from this horrible thing as it gathers vast amounts
of destructive energy.  A frightening intelligence seems apparent in the
depths of its being.

Along a Grassy Cliff~
Thick tufts of grey-green grass cover the hard soil of the ground beneath
you.  This grass covers the ground all the way up to the mountains, which
lie to the north, and to the edge of the cliff, where it looks out over
empty air at the earth far below this floating chunk of rock.  A slight
breeze is almost always present, sometimes graduating to hard gusts of wind.
The terrain shows the beating that it's taken over the years.  The cliff
continues to the east and west, and windswept plains spread out to the
north.

A Patch of Dead Grass Near the Cliff~
The southwestern edge of the mountain rises up above you to the north,
blocking any possible travel in that direction.  To the west and south, the
cliff drops straight down to the ground of Shalar, nearly a thousand meters
below.  The grass here is dead and slowly rotting.  A few impish corpses
litter the ground, and they have long since begun to decay as well.  The end
result of this leaves the air being quite foul here, despite the constant
breeze.  Something seems to have infected this area.

blows fiercely, causing the grass beneath you to ripple in the direction of
the wind.  A large mountain rests up to the north, and strangely enough,
some sort of waterfall roars away in the distance.  Its source and
destination aren't clear.

A Plain Stone Room~
The walls of this room are relatively smooth, and though they aren't
polished and maintained, it remains obvious that this is no natural
formation.  A chipped carving is set into the ground here, worn away to the
point of unrecognizability.  It looks almost like two faces, and one has
wavy lines radiating out from it, but not much more can be told about the
once elaborate carving.  A thin black line runs up and down the northern
wall, but nothing else of note catches your eye.

A Damp Earthen Cave~
Soft but firm soil lines the ground and ceiling of this cave, and
moss-like projections, perhaps roots, willow down from above.  The distant
rumbling of the seemingly out of place waterfall shakes the ground slightly,
filling the air with the thick scent of wet dirt.

Along the Base of a Mountain~
The foreboding shadow of the mountain looms grey-brown against the sky to
the north.  Cold, jagged rocks which have been carved by time, cover the
steep slope of the mountainside.  The soil is more dry here, and the tufts
of grey-green grass become far and few between.  The breeze is stronger here
than in the plains to the south, whistling and rushing across the uneven
rock of the mountain.  White wisps of cloud mingle among the towering spires
of the mountains peaks.  Off to the south the windswept plains expand
towards the edge of the cliffs.  The pitch black mouth of an ominous cave
lies open to the north of here.

A Steep Slope of Soft Dirt~
Several small rocks poke through the soft ground, but it is largely
blanketed in a deep layer of rich brown soil.  Cold, jagged rocks rise up on
either side of this small shute of dirt to the north and south.  The
grey-green grasses of the windswept plains move in the winds far off to the
south.  Moisture and the scent of moist earth wafts through the air which
blows steadily between the rocks.  The roaring sound of a waterfall echoes
against the rocks originating from the north.

Grassy Foothills~
The ground slopes upward toward the mountain, the terrain here more
rugged than the plains to the south.  Moist soil rarely peeks out from
beneath the thick tufts of grey-green grass that seems to cover a great deal

moisture and the scent of wet earth with it from the mysterious waterfall to

A Moss-Covered Ledge Before a Waterfall~
A grey ledge covered in grey-green moss borders the edge of a beautiful
waterfall.  To the east a deluge of water tumbles down the rocks on a sharp
decline towards the plains.  The smooth grey rock is moist from the constant
mist made when the water collides into the rocks below.  A mossy bridge made
of notched is attached to the ledge, and leads out over the waterfall.  Far

a dirt path leads along the edge of a cliff.

A Mossy Log Bridge, Overlooking a Great Structure~
Thick green moss clings to the wet logs which make up this ancient
bridge.  Crystal clear water rushes off the edge of the cliff, freeing
itself from the earth for a short time.  Soft tendrils of mist rise up from
the deep crevice below.  A strange, massive structure rises up to the north,
slightly shrouded in mist.  The dark blue surface of the structure gleams
dully in the daylight.  An ominous feeling emanates from the edifice which
stands in silent vigil over the bridge.  Upon the center of the bridge you
notice a strange bowl-shaped head resting uon a wooden stand.  To the east
and west the bridge leads off to the ledge of the cliff.

symbols have been carved and etched into the logs long ago.  A strange
bow-shaped head sits upon a stand in the center of the bridge.

A Moss-Covered Ledge Before a Waterfall~
A grey ledge covered in grey-green moss borders the edge of a beautiful
waterfall.  To the west a deluge of water tumbles down the rocks on a sharp
decline towards the plains.  The smooth grey rock is moist from the constant
mist made when the water collides into the rocks below.  A mossy bridge made
of notched is attached to the ledge, and leads out over the waterfall.  Far
off to the south the greyish hue of the plains can be seen, and to the north
a dirt path leads along the edge of a cliff.

A Steep Slope of Soft Dirt~
Several small rocks poke through the soft ground, but it is largely
blanketed in a deep layer of rich brown soil.  Cold, jagged rocks rise up on
either side of this small shute of dirt to the north and south.  The
grey-green grasses of the windswept plains far off to the south.  Moisture
and the scent of moist earth wafts through the air which blows steadily
between the rocks.  The roaring sound of a waterfall echos againsts the
rocks, originating from the north.

The ledge here is extremely thin, dropping down into a dark crevice
below.  A jagged wall of rock lines the edge of the trail making all passage
to the north impossible.  Grey-brown brambles cling to the cold dark rocks
of the mountains side, bearing their wickedly sharp thorns.  Loose rocks
litter the dry loose dirt along the slim trail.  The forboding peaks of the
mountains stand darkly against the horizon, wrapped in white wispy clouds.

Dark, moist rocks cover the side of this sharp decline next to the
waterfall.  Small threads of water sift down through the loose dirt and
rocks of the decline.  A thick mist swirls through the area, dancing and
writhing in the wind.  The rushing waterfall creates a deafening noise which
echos through the rocks.  A steep trail begins at the top of the decline,
and wet, rocky path begins near the bottom of the waterfall.

blows through the area, originating from the crashing falls to the west. 
The sound of the water careening into the rocks below creates a deafening

cavern after being filtered through the rushing waters of the falls.  Small
pools of water have collected in tiny depressions on the floor of the
cavern.  The deafening roar of the water careening into the rocks outside
echos through the tiny cavern.  Sharp stalactites hang down meanacingly from
