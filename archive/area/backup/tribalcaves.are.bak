whelp minotaur child undead~
a rotting minotaur whelp~
A small child with the head of a large bull clumsily hobbles through the cavern.
~
It could be sad, if it weren't so horrifyingly disgusting.  Dry flesh
raggedly droops from a large skull with tiny horns.  This small skeleton
seems as if it is being pulled around by some unseen force.

skeletal decorated minotaur warrior corpse~
a decorated warrior corpse~
A skeletal minotaur adorned with gems shuffles about, dragging a broken leg behind it.
~
A series of gems are set into the skull of this minotaur, but they are
covered in a film of dried blood and liquefied flesh.  Torn clothes hang
from the frame of the skeletal minotaur, shredded from its escape from the
earth.  One of its legs is broken at the shin, but it doesn't seem to feel
it.  It walks on the jagged bone, the remainder of the hooved leg dragged
along by a dried tendon and some cloth.

a mummified zealot~
A preserved minotaur corpse wrapped in a religious shroud wanders the cave.
~
The death shroud depicting the emblem of an unknown god or demon is
draped over the preserved flesh of this creature.  Acrid embalming fluid is
thickly layered on its ancient skin.  The mummy lurches forward, seemingly
unaware of your presence.

A Grassy Path~
The path takes on a less traveled appearance here as it heads toward
rather uninhabitable and unfavorable terrain.  The trees loom overhead,
suffocating, dark and threatening.  Their tangled roots make travel
difficult, and the thickness of the grass underfoot doesn't help.  To the
north, the path ends at a rock wall.

The Overgrown Mouth of a Cave~
The crude "path" ends here at a rock wall that scales the side of the
mountain to the north.  The trees loom overhead, suffocating, dark and
threatening.  Their tangled roots make travel difficult, and the thickness
of the grass underfoot doesn't help.  A cave opens its dark maw at the foot
of the rock wall.

A Dripping Cavern~
No light can penetrate the foliage above the cave's mouth.  It is already
pitch black.  Water drips from the sides and ceiling of the cave, echoing
through whatever lies beyond, to the north.

The Painted Caves~
The rough walls are covered with paintings of minotaur warriors fighting
and hunting.  There really is not a whole lot of variety, just a lot of
killing.  The ground is littered with shards of pottery, broken arrowheads
and pebbles.  A hollow shrieking fills the caves, but you can sense no wind.

The Pool of Endless Horrors~
A short, thin strip of salt rock is the only solid ground here.  A deep
pool of salt water covers the rest of the ground.  Jagged, ugly runes appear
glowing sporadically in the darkness, only to fade away.  The pool is filled
with carnage, but the smell of salt both masks it and complements its stink.
