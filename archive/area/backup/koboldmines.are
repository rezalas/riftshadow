A young goblin miner stands here with a gleam in his eye.
~
A few short years ago, he was dreaming of becoming a true miner.  Now,
this wish had come to be.  Bursting with enthusiasm, he is prepared to chip
away in the mines for long hours on end.  His endurence will likely match
his determination, for he appears sturdy enough for the harsh mining life.

Years of hard mining have left this old goblin in poor health.  Thin
limbs extend from the small frame, with very little strength left in them. 
His eyes tell a story of hardships overcome, and he speaks the words of

goblins.

goblin miner yells obscenities at the rest of the miners.  His voice is
extremelly annoying and quite strong, due to his massive complexion.  His
arms are all knotted muscles, however the rest of him is less muscular.  His
legs are quite scrawny and his belly is of gargantuan proportions, for a
goblin.

deposits of the crystal.  Glancing over him, you can tell that he is firmly
devoted to that cause.

Small rodent moves across the cave floor hastily.  Commonly found
wherever goblins are, rats thrive on their presence, due to large amounts of
waste that goblins live in.  Because they are so used to goblin presence,
these rats are more bold than their surface counterparts.  You notice they
pay you little heed.

Small shape, almost unnoticable in the cavern darkness, glides
efortlessly through the air.  Cave bat, a species that has been in these

way of larger species, such as goblins.

Before the Massive Stone Gate~
Huge bile of rock meets here, forming a natural chasm.  Between walls
ridden with minerals, goblins had built a massive protective stone gate. 
Carved from the most resilient of stone, it divides the inner goblin caves
from the rest of the world.  In the days long gone, it may have served a
defensive purpose, but nowadays, goblins leave it open as it lays on the
trade route.  Several torches are placed to the either side of the gate, so
as to allow more adventurous surface dwellers to prepare to brave the depths
lying north with greater ease.

The true beginning of the rough miners' cave system, this spacious cave
has walls that have recent scars embedded in them, along with the ancient
ones.  It seems that miners make it a habit to chip at the wall as they pass
on north-east deeper into the caves.  Quite possibly, this is for good luck.

Beginning of a Dark, Busy Hallway~
This is hallway is one of the first mining sites in this complex.  Signs
of busy activity are all around you: shouts of miners as they call each
other, singing of pickaxes as they strike in unison and an occasional curse.
The rock through which the hallway has been carved is rich in crystal, with
biles glimmering against the light.  Thick, stout wooden beams support the
cave ceiling safely.

The End of Dark, Busy Hallway~
This is the end of the central hallway that leads through the mines.  The
reason the miners had stopped here is the thinning of the crystal biles. 
Apparently, natural formation of softer rocks gave way to granite here and
the bile had moved elsewhere.  A well-beaten path leads towards the more
civilized section of mines leads south.  Deeper into the mines, a steep
slope leads down.

North End of Eastern Forgotten Cave~
You find yourself in the lair of gargantuan proportions, inhabited by
thin, agile plants.  The walls, if there are any, are covered in thick
lime-coloured slime -- no doubt, a vile excretion of the plants themselves. 
The source of the scent that was ever so pervasive throughout this Gods
forsaken complex of caves is finally before your eyes: the rotting, pulsing
and flailing arms of the plants themselves.

At the Corner of a Dark, Busy Hallway~
The hallway rich with crystal bile is perpetually busy.  As one shift of
miners leaves, the other one instantly takes their place.  The walls of the
hallway are heavily chipped, as pickaxes and hammers constantly batter them,
in search of more crystal.  Thick, stout supporting wooden beams look
stable, as they support a low ceiling.

The End of Dark, Busy Hallway~
This is the end of the central hallway that leads through the mines.  The
reason the miners had stopped here is the thinning of the crystal biles. 
Apparently, natural formation of softer rocks gave way to granite here and
the bile had moved elsewhere.  A well-beaten path leads towards the more
civilized section of mines leads south.  Deeper into the mines, a steep
slope leads down.

The steep ravine before you leads up, to the common area of the mines. 
All around you, there is nothing but darkness.  Although you cannot feel the
walls around you, you still feel entrapped.  This is due to the low ceiling
and the fact that in deep caves, such as there, there is no wind and the air
is dank and stale.  All around you, you hear busy chatter of a mine
production in full swing.

Particularly rich finding of crystal lode mining is the reason this

However, judging by the amount of work here, this will quickly change.  Only
the most sturdiest and strongest of the miners work here, because they were
able to surpress the weaker ones and keep them at bay.  The tunnel turns

The crystal is as strongly present in this cave as it is through the rest

they are too busy exploiting the shafts to the east of here.  The rock is
particularly soft here and it looks as if this spot will be very promising
indeed.  North and south, you notice expansive emptiness, with strange

West of the Busy Intersection~
Rough rock with jagged edges surrounds you.  Crystal bile can be seen
embedded in it, and the miners are busily digging away, amassing their
wealth.  Fine layer of dust lingers all throughout these caves, as specks of
dust cannot escape on any wind.  All around you, the sound of many pick-axes
can be heard.

This tunnel has seen better days: some time ago, while there was enough
crystal to attract the scores of best miners, this sector of caves was
bursting with activity.  Nowadays, second-tier miners have taken over,

The tunnel comes to an end here.  There is no crystal to be seen at all,
yet the tunnel is in good shape.  Even the debris that can be spotted

The quality of the air is somewhat better here.  This is likely due to
the fact that this point dominates the rest of the cave system visible to
you by its height.  Still, odours from below you drift up slowly of their
own accord, and you are soon reminded of the filth beneath you.  You can
continue to walk along the fortified wall either east or west.

The End of the Main Path through Stronghold~
The piles of debris stocked up against either side of the path cease to
exist here.  Rather, the chaotic arrangement of the garbage form a uniform
mass once again before your eyes.  The stench of the garbage is accentuated
by the strong scent of unwashed goblin bodies.

The visible signs of rampant carelesness are laid out in front of your

of the stronghold.  Where there is no debris, the stone has been charred by
what must have been a considerable fire.  The stench of goblin horde hovers

The distinguishing feature of this locale is the hut that raises above
the flat, natural floor of the stronghold.  The hut is obscured by the
darkness, the only clearly visible part of it being numerous strong stone
pillars that support it.  A rough and primitive stone ladder has been carved
into one of the pillars.

The Forechamber of the Hut~
The first chamber of the hut is as opulent, by goblin standards, as the
entrance.  This is the central intersection of the hut, with the doorways
leading west and north.  The walls are decorated with crude pictures, while
the floor has a few dark stains across it.  There only air that comes in or
out of the chamber comes from the entrance to the south of you.  Thus it is
not surprising that the stench is rather strong.

miles around.  The pictures are crude and they portray the horde of goblins
devouring another, smaller group of goblins.  The wall ornament is
interrupted by gaping door.  Further through the door, the stench of goblin
is strong.

The scattered debris lays all around you.  Heaps and heaps of the
discarded necessities of the life: torn, dried skins, broken weapons and
piles of excretements are all around you.  It is obvious that the denizens
of this stronghold did not attribute too much importance to the hygiene. 
However, one thing that makes this region stand out from the rest of the
fortress is that the debris has been pushed aside, so as to make a clear
path.

The Chamber of Fire~
Small chamber that branches off from the forechamber of the hut is
strangely devoid of any excessive ornaments which grace the rest of this
hut.  Ascetic and minimalistic, it seems that someone has taken a great deal
of effort to keep the place uncluttered by trinkets.  The ceiling of this
chamber is lower than the rest of the hut.  You notice that it is covered in
soot, as well as all the walls of the chamber.
