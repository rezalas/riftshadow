Held by a gigantous tentacle, you are hauled through the water at high
velocity.  While time slowly deludes into nothingness, you find time to
study your captor.  The large slimy tentacle is covered with small jagged
fishscales, their tips ending in barbed hooks.  Your thoughts divert and you
ponder briefly on where the tentacle is taking you.

Within a large cave~
Just a single fire burns here, and one or two moulded bedtrundles lie
scattered about.  A few raggish pelts are still nailed to the walls, yet
this part of the cave seems to have fallen in disuse.  Several collapsed
firepits line the floor, as well as various pieces of broken furniture.  The
end of the cave seems to have collapsed, a number of large boulders blocking
any passage deeper into the mountain.  Some rude sketches can still be
discerned on one of the larger boulders.

dry over a large wooden rack placed over three firepits, filling the cavern

Weaponracks are placed along the sides, containing a variety of spears and
tridents, and a small fireplace is set in the entrance.  From here, the

face in the south and west.  The lake's surface seems peculiarly placid from

Inside a monstrous abdomen~
Everything around you bulges and convexes, mangled by gigantous muscles
in the stomach of the tentacled beast.  Various acid juices pour out of
glands, their sharp and dizzying fumes mixing with the putrid odour of the
half-digested carrion residing here.  You realize that unless you find a way
out of here quickly, either by blade or magic, your future might be black
indeed.

Entrapped by a monstrous tentacle~
Held by a gigantous tentacle, you are hauled through the water at high
velocity.  While time slowly deludes into nothingness, you find time to
study your captor.  The large slimy tentacle is covered with small jagged
fishscales, their tips ending in barbed hooks.  Your thoughts divert and you
ponder briefly on where the tentacle is taking you.
