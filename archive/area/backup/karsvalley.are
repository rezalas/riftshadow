Within the Glimmering forest~
Ancient trees as wide as a ten feet stretch from the ground to the canopy
unbranched, upon reaching the canopy massive arms spread wide their fingers
straining to gain as much coverage as possible.  Wildlife noises echo
through the forest from trunk to trunk in a weird eerie way.  Light cascades
through the canopy upon each gust of wind, beams of light strike spots
lighting it up for a brief moment before the shifting canopy casts it in
shadow again.

Southern trail~
A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots
occasional surface through the bare packed dirt.  On either side of the
trail are bushes and young trees waiting for a lucky break when they might
be able to spring up to take the place of a fallen giant.  A strong breeze
gusts its way up and down the trail, swirling with it lose dirt and the rare
fallen leaf.

The edge of the forest~
Ancient trees reach to the upper canopy as smaller bushes and shrugs
strive to reach the edge of the forest.  The mountain starts to slope slowly
then rapidly climbs into a cliff face that is covered with eight to ten foot
high shrubs.  The breeze is a lot stronger here at the edge of the forest
where the ancient trees hold little cover over the foothill.

A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots

culling its ability to absorb light at the canopy level and enabling enough

patches of grass has started to grow in the fertile ground.  Smaller
wildlife can be seen scurrying from bush to bush as the occasional bird can

A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots
occasional surface through the bare packed dirt.  On either side of the
trail are bushes and young trees waiting for a lucky break when they might
be able to spring up to take the place of a fallen giant.  A strong breeze
gusts its way up and down the trail, swirling with it lose dirt and the rare
fallen leaf.

grow.  When light manages to break through the canopy above the spring
luminates into a iradescent blue.

Within the Glimmering forest~
Ancient trees as wide as a ten feet stretch from the ground to the canopy
unbranched, upon reaching the canopy massive arms spread wide their fingers
straining to gain as much coverage as possible.  Wildlife noises echo
through the forest from trunk to trunk in a weird eerie way.  Light cascades
through the canopy upon each gust of wind, beams of light strike spots
lighting it up for a brief moment before the shifting canopy casts it in
shadow again.

The edge of the forest~
Ancient trees reach to the upper canopy as smaller bushes and shrugs
strive to reach the edge of the forest.  The mountain starts to slope slowly
then rapidly climbs into a cliff face that is covered with eight to ten foot
high shrubs.  The breeze is a lot stronger here at the edge of the forest
where the ancient trees hold little cover over the foothill.

Within the Glimmering forest~
Some small vegetation has managed to strangle a tree of its sustenance,
culling its ability to absorb light at the canopy level and enabling enough
light to shine through to provide for those plants underneath it.  Even
patches of grass has started to grow in the fertile ground.  Smaller
wildlife can be seen scurrying from bush to bush as the occasional bird can
be seen flying through the maze of tree trunks.

Western trail~
A bare dirt trail snakes its way through the forest, thick gnarled roots
occasional surface through the bare packed dirt.  On either side of the
trail are bushes and young trees waiting for a lucky break when they might
be able to spring up to take the place of a fallen giant.  A strong breeze
gusts its way up and down the trail, swirling with it lose dirt and the rare
fallen leaf.

across the mountainside.  Sections of rocks have crumbled away making this
trail extremely dangerous.  With the diminished cover of the bushes the wind
gusts are considerably stronger here.  The footing and wind conditions could
make for a dangerous crossing.

To the east a thick forest canopy can be seen, bird life can be seen
flying from treetop to treetop.  The occasional larger tree has punctured
the canopy and has managed to stretch its upper fingers out above those
around it, soaking up as much light as possible.

The cliff has many fissures and gaps through the stone, sediment over
time and through erosion has settled here providing viable footholds for
vegetation to take hold.

Within the Hermits abode~
Stepping into this small abode is quiet an outstanding sight, A half
spherical cage grows to about the height of ten feet.  Branches have woven
themselves over and under each other as it guided by some mystical force. 
Upon the ground even the rocks appear to be well worn and in comfortable
looking shapes, a slight rise in the center that is reasonably level appears
to be a table.  Small sunken indentations around the raised section of stone
appear to be cushioned positions to sit.

Within the hidden caves~
This natural cavern looks like water at one stage had carved out its
bowls.  When the cavern had neared the surface the pressure had caused a
collapsed and the fallen rock looks to have blocked off the water causing it
to flow in a different route.  Long needles of light puncture the darkness
of this cave splintering off in a myriad of shards when it strikes the rocks
strewn over the floor.  The air is still fairly damp and a large amount of
lichen and mosses grow upon the walls.

Strew across this raised section is what looks to be an extremely large
nest, belonging to which creature you do not know.
