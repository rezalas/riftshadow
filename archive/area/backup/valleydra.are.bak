A mountain goat stands here grazing.  It does not seem to notice you and
continues on as if it is all alone.  The white goat of curly fur reachs up
to its head where two curled horns reach over and around its ears.  As you
look closer you notice that its legs are covered in a reddish-brown dirt of
the mountains.

A reddish-brown feline moves silently.  It licks its lips as it moves
from shadow to shadow, never fully taking its eyes off of you.  Long black
whiskers cover the end of its snout, with black fur markings under its eyes
and around its ears.  The animal seems to be calculating the right time for
a perfect pounce.

mountain goat~
A fidgity moving mountain goat stands before you.
~
A large mountain goat stands here grazing.  His shoulders, legs, and
hindquaters quiver in an alert state.  His shaggy white pelt corkscrews in
chaos off of his hide.  Two large horns curl back from the top of his head
over his ears.  All of the sudden his body freezes and his neck lashes
around bringing his head up, eyes intently studying the rock cliffs further
up.  Apparently at ease, he turns back to grazing.

A human cloaked in reds, browns, and greens crouches here behind a rocky
bastion that is made from a cliff.  With a glance he takes you in, and keeps
his concealment.  He returns to study his prey that is futher down under the
cliff.  His face is covered with a green piece of fabric, he moves with slow
smooth motions as he continues to peer over the side of the cliff apparently
waiting for the perfect time to snare his prey.  A strange curved bladed
dagger rests upside down in his hand, as well as a sword hilt that sticks
out of the back of his cloak.

A grotesque hobgoblin stands here fidgeting.  Worrie shines bright in his
eyes as he peers outside the cave watching for travelers.  His eyes dart
from copse to copse trying to be aware of everything outside of this cave. 
His ears have cuts and splices in them, and a large ring hangs from his
bottom lip.  Ripped soiled clothing covers his body.  The brownish-green
skin on his arms and legs are bruised and scarred, and he hunches over to
one side as if covering a long gone wound.

made of rusted metal, and she wears a large hook through the middle of her

Vrok the Troll Mercenary stands here, brandishing a large greatsword continuesly dripping with blood.
~
Smaller but smarter than most of his kin, Vrok abandon his tribe after years of fighting for survival among his cruel kin. He has a long pointed nose that down past his scrunched features of his face. Large black orbs for eyes and short dredded black hair on the back of his head give him an unnerving appearance. He wears a shirt of chainmail and plated armguards that double as partial covering gloves. Spikes on his shoulders and a sheath on his back for the greatsword in his hand, you also see two small masterworked throwing axe hanging on either side of his belt. Seeming very board, Vrok stands here licking his great sword. When he sees you he grins licks once more and then streaks towards you with the greatsword raised high, screaming a battlecry.

peaks look as though they were a pit fall for the divine.  The peaks, cruel
as any predator, are concealed with snow so that they convey a softer image
of what lies below.  The scene is breath taking in this portrayal of the
young mountain range, seconded only to the actual viewing of the scene
itself.

his prey seem to voice a certain danger of the beautiful setting that has
been captured in this picture.  Further into the distance, a lush green
valley can be seen spreading out into the horizon.

smooth black and white cane is held in his hand completing the pose.  With a
straight back, he stands tall among the mountain pass that tower over him. 
Over the cliff a flat plains area stretches out as far as the eye can see. 
Colorful clothes of another time and place adorn his body loosely.  A
beautiful face has done justice to the artist's subject, with piercing
blue-green eyes radiating a warmth even though it is only a woven picture.

A Path Descending into the Valley of Dra~
The prairie grasses suddenly stop as if they ran smack dab into the
barricade that the red mountain range has made for itself.  Jagged rocks and
tall steep walls shadow a small path decending down into the valley ahead. 
The rugged range would be no place for an occasional traveler, only the most
skilled will attempt to cross this mountain range, even through a valley
such as this one.  The green vegatation looks tiny at this hieght.

The Lush Green of the Valley~
Very healthy trees and other vegetation seem to be thriving here.  The
greenness has spread out a bit from the path, and it now supports the huge
trees that crowd the ceiling of the canopy.  Slivers of light peek through
small holes in the canopy, dancing about with the swaying of the leaves. 
The grass is long skinny blades that are a deep dark green, soft as silk
that cushin every footfall.  A small break in the trees reveals a concealed
pathway up into the valley walls.  A few trees scattered amongst the others
produce an assortment of berries and new strange types of fruit.  Some of
the trees have needle shapped leaves as others have a velvet look to them,
and a varieties of shrubs and bushes are cluttered around each other between
trees.

The Lush Green of the Valley~
Very healthy trees and other vegetation seem to be thriving here.  The
greenness has spread out a bit from the path, and it now supports the huge
trees that crowd the ceiling of the canopy.  Slivers of light peek through
small holes in the canopy, dancing about with the swaying of the leaves. 
The grass is long skinny blades that are a deep dark green, soft as silk
that cushin every footfall.  A few trees scattered amongst the others
produce an assortment of berries and new strange types of fruit.  Some of
the trees have needle shapped leaves as others have a velvet look to them,
and a varieties of shrubs and bushes are cluttered around each other between
trees.

The rocky trail continues through the valley as treacherous as through
the pass.  Large sharp rocks are hidden within the surrounding foliage, and
some lie on the pathway.  The trees are bunched togather so tight that the
path has become narrow through time.  Large trees, small trees, shrubbery
and prairie grass grow in every available spot.  The valley is very quiet,
only the wind passing through the canopy is audible.  From time to time
wildlife can be seen grazing, or a bird perched in a tree with nothing to

Here the foliage is much more dense and irregular than in any other place

making travel very hard.  Rocks and pebbles scarcely cover the ground, but
still making foot placement difficult.  A few branches here and there have
been snapped and are hanging by just the bark.  Sticks and fruit also cover
the ground as well short coarse grass pokes up between them and the rocks.

The rocky trail continues through the valley as treacherous as through
the pass.  Large sharp rocks are hidden within the surrounding foliage, and
some lie on the pathway.  The trees are bunched togather so tight that the
path has become narrow through time.  Large trees, small trees, shrubbery
and prairie grass grow in every available spot.  The valley is very quiet,

within this valley.  The trees leaves and branches criss cross through here
making travel very hard.  Rocks and pebbles scarcely cover the ground, but
still making foot placement difficult.  A few branches here and there have
been snapped and are hanging by just the bark.  Sticks and fruit also cover
the ground as well short coarse grass pokes up between them and the rocks.

A Narrow Pathway Through the Valley~
The rocky trail continues through the valley as treacherous as through
the pass.  Large sharp rocks are hidden within the surrounding foliage, and
some lie on the pathway.  The trees are bunched togather so tight that the
path has become narrow through time.  Large trees, small trees, shrubbery
and prairie grass grow in every available spot.  The valley is very quiet,
only the wind passing through the canopy is audible.  From time to time
wildlife can be seen grazing, or a bird perched in a tree with nothing to
sing about.

A Small Cave~
This small cave is crapped and tiny.  The ceiling only reaches five feet
three inches tall.  It is very circular, all the way to the top.  The width
is nearly the same as the hieght.  On the floor in the back of the cave a
seam of a stone slab is pulled apart slightly, hinting at perhaps a trap
door.  The walls are smooth and cool, and the floor is covered in rocks and
pebbles.

A Shallow Cave~
A small cave big enough to get out of the sandstorms is here.  It is
carved out of rock of the mountains, enough for a few to sit comfortibly. 
It is not deep enough to make a home from, but it certainly can provide
shelter.  The walls are smooth and warm to the touch, which heats the open
space of the shallow cave.  Carved just right by the withering of time, a
small protrudent stone looks to be carved as one piece from the back of the
cave making a nice bench.

A Clear Path into the Waste of Ven~
The mountains suddenly cease to move towards the west.  A few rocks lay
around out here, fell and rolled down from the steep mountain side above. 
The end of dunes stretch this far, trying to reach over the mountain range
to no avail.  The mountains look like enormous titans standing in a line
from here.  The jagged peaks are a reddish-brown color and covered with
snow.

Only a few smooth red rocks are on the ground, they seem to have been worn from the sound that fills this area like dirt and grass.
