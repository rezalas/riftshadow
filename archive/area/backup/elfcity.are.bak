Before a Great Waterfall~
Standing before this massive waterfall is almost awe-inspiring.  The loud
roar of the crashing water seems to drown out anything and everything else
almost so loud that you feel your ears may burst.  The cool droplets of
water spraying from the crashing water pelt you stinging slightly though
feeling slightly refreshing.

The roar of the waterfall is still quite loud and almost echoing within
this cave.  The floor is lined with puddles and water seems to be dripping
from the ceiling and everything is damp from the spraying water of the

The roar of the waterfall can still be heard though not nearly as loud as
before.  The sound seems to come from every direction however.  Water drips
from the ceiling in such a fashion that when they hit the puddles they have
made they seem to make music.

Small ledge behind a waterfall~
Directly to the east is a waterfall that continues falling down past the
small outstretch of land sticking out of the side of this mountain.  The
ledge seems to extend out far enough to stand on and continue around the
side of the mountain to the south.

A ledge overlooking Lorithia~
Standing on the side of this mountain you can see Lorithia the Elven
Capital off to the east.  There isn't much room to move on this ledge and
falling looks unfortunate at best.  On the south most side of this ledge is
a ladder leading down the mountain.

There is a ledge here to rest on the path down the ladder.  Off to the

At the foot of a mountain~
Standing at the base of this relatively short mountain you see a trail
off to the east leading to the gates of Lorithia.  A rope bridge is all that
lies between here and the gates fortunatly the bridge looks in much better
than the ladder leading up the mountain.

A sturdy rope bridge~
This rope bridge seems like it would support a great deal of weight as
the strong wind blowing in this canyon is not even budging it.  The wooden
planks don't look worn or weathered nor do the ropes used to hold as you
cross it.  It is in such good condition it would seem that it was just
built.

Before the gates to Lorithia~
There is a pair of elaborately designed gates that open up to Lorithia to
the east.  The gates have a sign on the right side stating that the gates
close at nightfall and do not open till day.  The ground is paved in white
marble which is also what the gate is made of.

waterfalls and the area is under a constant mist.  The city seems to be
considerable in size the road beneath you is well kept and very nice.

This street seems to be one of the main streets of the city and well kept
at that.  The mist seems to be thick in this part of the city as there is a

the building and off of the cliff to the southwest.
