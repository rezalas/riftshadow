Forests lining the Old Southern Road~
Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that
has survived above all others.

Along the Old Southern Road~
Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into dry puddles. Two deep
tracks run down each side of the road from the heavy carts that use it,
grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions
indicating that the road has not seen regular use in some time. On the
edge of the road the grass thrives and grows to almost two feet, long
blades hang out over the road.

Deep within the thick forest~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't
sound dangerous.

Deep within the thick forest~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't
sound dangerous.

Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into dry puddles. Two deep

grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions

The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the

smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird

Grasses cover the undulating ground of the fields to the side of the old
southern road. Sprouting up from the thick weave of grasses is the
occasional shrub and small bush. Large rocks can be seen raising their
head above the tips of the long grasses, lizards absorbing the heat lay
on the surface. The winds passing over the grasses flows like a river
weaving in and out through the rocks and bushes.

Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into dry puddles. Two deep

grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions

Forests lining the Old Southern Road~
Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that
has survived above all others.

Deep within the thick forest~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't
sound dangerous.

begun to weave it's web of vines and hanging shrubs. Cutting your way through
you can just tell where the trail has continued onward. You notice that there
are no longer any noises coming from the forest.
