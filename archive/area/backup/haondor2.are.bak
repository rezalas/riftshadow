Before the Gates of Cimar~
The massive Western Arch of Cimar towers before you, a monument to mortal
ingenuity and testament to the wealth of glorious Cimar.  Reaching well over
forty feet towards the skies, the arch supports massive blocks of granite
that reach even higher.  Beyond the equally massive wooden gates to the
east, stretches a broad thoroughfare that runs through the heart of Cimar
The clamor of restless activity emanates from the east, rolling out across
the worn cobblestone roads of the city.  To the west, a dirt path leads out
into the downs beyond.

Back down the road to the east you notice the massive walls of Cimar looming
over the treetops.  Scrubby foliage lies to either side of the path here,
but ends abruptly at the edge of the downs.  The cobblestone path which
leads from Cimar spreads out to the west, and then dissipates into a grassy

waft through the air.  Massive brown trunks knotted and weathered stand side

A Stoney Clearing Within the Woodlands~
The trees part overhead giving way to the open air above.  Huge smooth
stones are strewn randomly throughout the clearing.  A mass of green leafy
vines creep along the ground, wrapping themselves about the bases of the
stones as if to hold them in place.  All around the clearing tall trees
stand, solemnly keeping watch over the stoney clearing.  The smell of
standing water wafts in from the south, in the direction of the lowlands.

A Muddy Path Through the Waterlogged Timber~
Thick, black muck covers the watery ground.  Tall grey trees rise high
above you, firmly planted within the mire.  Small tufts of grass sit loosly
on the edge of the muddy path.  Waterlogged timber lies half sunken in the
muck, slowly being decomposed by moss and small delicate plants.  Small
holes have been made in the sides' of trees as a home for the many birds
throughout the woodlands.  Off to the north a small clearing can be seen,
and to the south the ground becomes even soggier.

A Mossy Trail Through the Thick Underwood~
A host of green-gray moss grows upon the trunks and bases of the trees. 
Tall oak and maple rise high above you forming a sort of primal cathedral. 
The perpetual rustle of leaves, and the smells of damp soil waft through the
air.  The massive brown trunks, knotted and weathered stand thick, leading
down to the deep burrowing roots.  The path itself is composed of an inch of
fallen leaves, and large masses of moss lining the edges.  Occasionally
small shafts of sunlight fight their way through the thick canopy overhead,
to dance across the forest floor.

you waters crash into jagged rocks, making a crystalline sound.  Foam from
the rough waters lap up against the stoney river banks.  Swirling eddies

At the Base of a Magnificent Waterfall~
A torrent of waters comes pouring down from the cliff high above you. 
The water careens into the rocks at the base of the falls with a deafening
roar.  A fine veil of mist floats through the air refracting the light into
a beautiful spectrum during the daylight.  Hearty green moss clings to the
damp faces of the rocky cliff.  High above, large eyries can be seen sitting
upon various rock shelves.  The swirling waters beneath the falls begin to
more quickly as they flow silently to the south.

river, producing a crystalline noise.  Foam from the rough waters laps up

The current slows down significantly here, as the land begins to become
more level.  The width of the river expands, and flows patiently around the
rocks and trees on its journey towards the marshes.  The river has overun

sheet of water to the south.  The floor shimmers as the light from the
outside is twisted and contorted as it passes through the falls.  The
ceiling drips constantly upon the smooth wet floor over the cavern, which
