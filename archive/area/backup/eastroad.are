Before the Gates of Cimar~
The massive Eastern Arch of Cimar towers before you, a monument to mortal
ingenuity and testament to the wealth of glorious Cimar.  Reaching well over
forty feet towards the skies, the arch supports massive blocks of granite
that reach even higher.  Beyond the equally massive wooden gates to the
west, stretches a broad thoroughfare that runs through the heart of Cimar. 
The clamor of restless activity emanates from the west, rolling out across
the worn cobblestone roads of the city.  To the east, the road runs between
two narrow walls before widening and disappearing into the horizon.

E eastern arch~
You can scarcely believe such a thing has been built... but yet, there it
is.  Taller than most buildings in the city, this unsupported arch somehow
sustains not only its own massive weight, but that of the portion of the
wall which stretches above it.
~
E gate gates~
The gates, while inherently less impressive than the Eastern Arch itself,
are still quite an impressive site.  Finding trees the size of these
massive beams would be a task in itself, let alone assembling them.

A Narrow-Walled Avenue~
The path is narrow here, cramped between the walls of massive guard
towers that loom to the north and south.  Armored silhouettes patrol the
ramparts above, and an occasional glint of steel is visible through one of
the myriad arrowslits that line the side of each tower.  The walls of Cimar
and the great Eastern Arch loom to the west, while the road narrows
considerable and stretches eastward toward the horizon, flanked by rows of
trees on either side.

The forest around you is remarkably dense here, with rows of trees
reaching up to blot out all but tiny slivers of sky.  The presence of
wildlife surrounds you, from the faint chirping of crickets, to the mossy
earth beneath your feet, to the blurs of motion at the edge of your field of
vision.  Though the woods become impenetrably dense to the north and west,
the forest stretches eastward, and through breaks in the trees to the south,
you can clearly make out the beginning of the Cimarrite Causeway.  Amazing,
how nature can be so lush and vibrant mere feet away from the stamp of
civilization.

Approaching the Walls of Cimar~
The road here is broad, leading westward toward the towering walls of
Cimar, where the path narrows and runs between two guard towers.  Eastward,
the road stretches on well into the distance, widening further as it carves
a clean swath from the surrounding forests.  Evenly-spaced rows of trees
line the road on the northern and southern sides here, the gaps revealing a
surprisingly lush verdant sprawl.  Weeds and assorted other small brush peek
through the odd space between the cobblestones here, serving as a reminder
of the limits of mortal encroachment upon nature.

Framed to the east and west by very dense foliage, this worn trail leads
between the Cimarrite Causeway to the north and the Old Southern Road in the
opposite direction.  The dirt trail itself, tamped into hard earth by many
passing feet, lets up very little dust as you pass.  The shade offered by
the huge, leafy branches above you is most welcome during the heat of the
day, and yet casts an almost eerie pallor over the area during the moonlit
night.  Cobble beckons to the north and south, deep forest to the east and

At the Edge of a Swamp~
The ground here has become rather wet and soggy, drowning most of the
shorter varieties of grass that grow nearby.  A few dark, moss-covered trees
spring up here and there, all emanating a mildewy stench.  Many more spring
up to the south, where a humid haze settles about the area.  To the north
lies the relative safety and comfort of the Great Shalaran Road.

Along the Cimarrite Causeway~
This broad cobblestone road, known far and wide as the Great Shalaran
Road, has been paved and re-paved many times through the centuries.  To the
north and south, the sizeable forests of the region grow wild, deciduous and
evergreen trees both intermingling and creating a field of patchwork green.

Within the Dense Foliage~
The forest around you is remarkably dense here, with rows of trees
reaching up to blot out all but tiny slivers of sky.  The presence of
wildlife surrounds you, from the faint chirping of crickets, to the mossy
earth beneath your feet, to the blurs of motion at the edge of your field of
vision.  The forest stretches to the east and west, but the trees to the

At a Traveler's Camp~
A small lean-to constructed of a large burlap sheet draped over the low
branch of a pine tree occupies the northern edge of this tiny clearing.  A
crackling fire at the center of the area pops and fizzles, sending glowing
sparks upward in a dancing spiral.  The leafy branches wave and sway in the
rising heat and smoke from the campfire, resulting in an almost dreamlike
ocean-wave effect... you fight off the urge to lie back and stare at the
sky.  To all sides but the south, trees grow very closely together, and you
cannot see what lies beyond.  South of here, some dense foliage grows at the
edge of the Great Shalaran Road.

Thick shrubs and small trees grow up to about fifteen feet here, there is
the occasional breeze that rustles the branches and leaves, the rich smell
of foliage fills your nose and carries a slight scent of pollen.  At the
base of all the shrubs and small trees are small animal paths, about three
to four feet high and well used.  The ground is covered with dead material
fallen from the surrounding plant life, in some areas where the trails are
often used the ground is worn bare to the compacted dirt underneath.

This broad cobblestone road, known far and wide as the Great Shalaran
Road, has been paved and re-paved many times through the centuries.  To the
north and south, the sizeable forests of the region grow wild, deciduous and
evergreen trees both intermingling and creating a field of patchwork green.

This area of the forest is dry compared to the marshy, swamp-like ground
to the west.  South of the road, it must somehow get less light than other
places in this region... for this entire area is covered in pitch darkness. 
The trees are black, the ground is scorched dark brown, and even the leaves
above you are such a deep shade of green that they seem to swallow light. 
Very little animal activity rises up in this area, and the surroundings are
very still and quiet.  To the north, you see the light of the Great Shalaran

An Abandoned Camp~
The firepit here has been kicked over and drowned beneath a tiny lake of
water.  A swath of glowing embers to one side indicates that this campsite
has not been in its current state for very long.  Through the smoke and soot
in the air, the light from above stabs downward, patterning itself after the
canopy of vegetation overhead.  A twig snaps, a leaf rustles, and suddenly
every sound around you is reminiscent of an approaching bandit.  Back to the

road, and safety.

Before a Shaded Spring~
The thick, gnarled tangles have parted, revealing a small clearing; some
larger trees have found root here and managed to survive.  The air is more
moist here, and the quiet yet soothing noises from the spring come to your
ears, along with the occasional bird call.  Around the edge of the spring is
a line of large rocks which holds back the water making the spring deeper. 
Over time, the gaps in between the rocks have been filled with soil and
plants have taken hold.  A weird assortment of long grasses sprout outward
over the edges of the spring.

day is the evidence of vandalizing thieves stashing loot beneath the floor,
trampling wayward beasts confused at the lack of a path or even trees, and
many thousand wild birds unceremoniously leaving offerings before departing.

The Beginnings of an Old Road~
The ground here is torn up and hardened by great amounts of travel, lack
of care and weather.  Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into
dry puddles.  Two deep trakc run down each side of the road from the heavy
carts that use it, grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all
directions, indicating that the road has not seen regular use in some time. 
On the edge of the road, the grass thrives and grows almost two feet, long
blades hang over the road.
