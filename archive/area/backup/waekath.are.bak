a haggard old man~
A old, hunched over man clothed in dirty rags stands here.
~
Dark green moss grows on this old mans dingy clothing.  His face is
wrinkled and weather by the years, but his eyes shine vibrantly beneath his
bushy eyebrows.  A gnarled mess of silvery hair sits atop his head with
small twigs and leaves tangled in it.

A Thick Grove of Evergreen~
Hundreds of old gnarled evergreens reach towards the sky above.  Thick
roots creep along the ground, disappearing into the rich soil.  A soft
blanket of dead pine needles covers the ground all round you.  To the east a
massive rock face covered in moss and lichens rises up above the trees.  It
appears that the rock faces has been sundered here, producing a dark
crevice.

Within a Fissure~
Imposing walls of rock rise solemnly overhead.  Spectacular veins of
marble, granite, and crystal mingle together forming a natural tapestry. 
Millions of tiny shards of rocks litter the ground here, accumulating from
years of weathering.  Small shafts of light pierce through the darkness
originating from the east and west.

On the Edge of a Tranquil Pond~
Small tufts of grass stick up between the rocks on the shore here. 
Crystal clear water laps up quietly against the smooth rocks of the shore
here.  An occasional hawk can be seen soaring over the small pond.  To the
west a massive rock face rises against the horizon.  A small wooden bridge

Large dragonflies dart back and forth across the pond upon invisible wings.

Crossing a Small Wooden Bridge~
Rugged wooden boards weathered by time make up this small bridge.  Thin
wooden railings run the length and end in a scroll at either end.  The clear
water of the pond lies nearly ten feet below the top of the bridge, giving a
splendid view.  To the east the bridge leads over to a small island shaded
by an immense tree.  To the west a massive rock face looms at the edge of
the pond.

The Shaded Sanctuary~
An immense multi-trunked ironwood tree stands majestically in the center
of this small island.  Lavender and pink blossoms are spread amongst the
dense canopy.  Heavy dark-brown bark covers the two trunks.  Insects and
birds abound within the ironwood complex which provides shelter and
protection.  The dense canopy provides protection from the harsh elements,
allowing young scrubby plants and wildflowers to flourish.  The young plant
growth and wildflowers cluster near the base of the ironwood, taking
advantage of the rich soil it provides.
