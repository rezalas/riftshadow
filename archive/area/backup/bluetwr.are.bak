evil that destroyed the city and kept as a taunting reminder of the fall of the
elves. The power of pure magic hums around him and even his eyes glow with the

E blue seal parchment~
The writing on the parchment relates how the elves of Myth Drannor were used
as sacrifices to provide the pure blood needed to help raise and evil of total
corruption and unspeakable power that lay dormant beneath the city. Thie red
bloodletting was to be accompanied by two other merging powers, that of the
pure magics, the blue energies, and the divine magics, green energies. Yet
something went wrong and now forces of darkness are fighting for the last
keys to the power that lies hidden. Once the red, blue and green are finally
joined the black tower will reveal it's secrets..

Entrance to Xal Ocilyra Tower~
The crumbling tower ahead is built for hundreds of square blocks of dark,
aged granite crowned in black iron spires.  There is no gate, only a dingy
corridor that leads into the blackness within.  The surrounding area is
desolate and barren and the only sounds to be heard are the eerie creeks and
clangs coming from deep within the heart of the gloom- stricken tower.  High
above the ground level the faint flickering of orange flames can be seen
infrequently licking the edge of the black-trimmed windows.  The only
obvious exit, save for back into the dark forest is into the pitch black
corridor and into the tower.

A dark, gloom-filled corridor~
The only light in this dark, forsaking place is what streaks in from the
corridors breach to the west.  The floor is littered with dust and chipped
rock, making it apparent that the tower is crudely cared for and centuries
old.  It is too dark to tell how large the corridor is, but it's ceiling
exceeds your grasp.  Periodically the forbidding red eyes of unknown
creatures blinks into the emptiness before disappearing into the gloom.  The
dingy hallway exits to the west and continues up a short flight of stairs to
the east, which can barely be seen in the darkness of this eternal night.

The twilight fades ever so slightly along the edge of this large
platform, still offering no visibility.  To the west is a black iron gate
which leads into a cell of some kind, the likes of which seem horrific. 
Laying on the floor at the foot of the cells iron gate are a few small
animal bones and scraps of newer carrion, perhaps too rotten for even a
dying slave to eat.  Hanging from a hook next to the door are a few short
lengths of chains and manacles.  The darkness resides in all directions.

This open platform is covered in a hazy twilight that is cast by the faint
shimmer of dying oil lamps in the shade of the towers darkness.  The cold
stone floor and chilly think air can only remind one of the despair and pain
that forever lingers within these walls.  It is there that one can find the
first sigh of life within these harrowed walls.  Colossal cloaked figures
roam the platform in silence, some of them dragging small creatures, perhaps
slaves or prisoners, in chains.  The platform extends in all directions.

that it manifests itself as raw fire, but blue and without the heat. The stairs
head upwards.

The Witch Queen's Watch~
This room is unlike any other in the tower. There is no energy shimmering in
the air, no crackling sounds or burning blue flames. Rather it is a plain and
empty study with nothing of interest but a single pentegram inscribed in the
floor for protection against some kind of unholy beast. The only exit is to
the north through the door.

A gloomy prison cell~
This dark cell is only large enough to fit a large human man at best, and
even so it constricts with the feeling of hopelessness and despair.  Two
slits form a small window on the western wall, its streaks of faint light
are just enough to taunt a man with the unobtainable thought of freedom. 
The door is made of flat iron bars, their joints rusted at the corners.  In
the furthest corner of the dark cell is what appears to be the shadow of a
man, or perhaps just the essence of one who wasted away in the timelessness
of the tower.
