disfigured zombie man~
a disfigured zombie~
An apparently diseased man staggers through the corridor, bumping into walls.
~
This dirty diseased creature stumbles as it moves, causing the scraps of
linen that still cling to its body to sway as if in the breeze.  Its skin
sags and hangs bloated from its face and body.  A horrible stench of rot
emanates from the creature and everything it touches.  The look of pure
hunger in its eyes makes you wonder if this creature is alive at all...

a groaning ghoul~
A grotesque figure shambles through the catacombs at an unnatural speed, groaning loudly.
~
This short, squat figure represents a step in the evolution of undead. 
Its rotting skin bulges with muscles as cold as the earth.  The small,
shrunken head appears even smaller because of the rippling shoulder and arm
muscles that surround it.  Dried trails of pus lead to infected yellow eyes
sunken deep in the creature's skull.  The minimal intelligence visible in
those eyes shows why this was only a step.

an ancient skeleton~
A skeleton awkwardly attempts to walk through the crumbling corridors.
~
Splintering ashen bones seem to move and walk without direction.  These
bones have clearly seen better days as they frantically claw at anything
around them.  No weapons or armor hang from the bones, though the blood
covering them is too fresh to be theirs.  They seem to be all human bones,
but the hands are strangely clawed.

a half-lich~
A tall skeletal figure paces the crypt, examining and re-examining its surroundings.
~
All of nature's laws are defied in this very one being.  Some portions of
him are skeletal, while others seem entirely human.  A cruel line divides
his face, with one eye socket sitting empty and the other containing a
bloody orb.  Bleach-white bones erupt from under the edges of the skin that
remains.  An expression that covers everything from utter depression to
absolute rage adorns the human side of his face.  Scars and open wounds on
his skin stand out to remind himself that as dead as he is, he still bleeds.

A battered elven slave struggles to complete the temple.

This slave wears nothing but a ragged loincloth as he toils, building
monuments to Carantoc.  His once-beautiful face is now battered and scarred.
His expression is one of pain and horror.  His eyes scream with revulsion at
the horrors he has seen.  Open wounds, burns, and lashings scar his back.

The Foyer of a Great Mausoleum~
The barren granite hallway insulates the room from external sounds. 
Stillness reigns as you pass through this segment of the foyer.  The walls,
completely bare, form a prison that prevents your escape.  Entombed in this
silent passageway, you look up to the ceiling, eight feet up, to find
something to break the monotony, but find nothing.  The light enters through
tiny slits high up on the walls.  The hallway continues to the north and

streams in from the open southern entrance.  The walls are made of seamless
granite, wholly barren and bleak.  Two identical desks sit side by side,
meticulously clean.  Despite their cleanliness, the desks appear to be
abandoned.  The hallways extend to the east and west, while the compound

Dust and the sound of hard work fill the air with their chorus.  Battered
slaves busily build furnishings for a large black altar that fills most of
the room.  The construction moves at a fevered pace, though you see no
worshippers in waiting.  You'd expect the sounds to reverberate through the
surrounding halls, but instead it seems to stop dead.  No overseers or
slavedrivers with whips stand over the slaves.  A grand chamber opens up to
the north, while the hallway continues to the east and west.

The Entrance to the Corrupted Fane~
Cold, hard silence sits heavily on this barren room.  A dim light shines
from several candles on the walls.  The room is exquisitely clean, with not
a bit of dirt, dust, or anything else on the walls or the floor.  A strange
feeling accompanies the emptiness in this room.  No living creatures stir
and nothing breaks the extreme silence.  Despite the nausea in your stomach,
you feel drawn to continue forward.

The Corrupted Fane~
Harsh red light floods your vision, pouring in from the south.  Even the
pale gray of the walls seems to reflect the hellish light.  The floor is
covered with an intricate mosaic, displaying a large hellhound.  Intense
cold seems to accompany the red light as it rushes in, illuminating a
shadowy alcove in the northern wall.  Though devoid of all life, the room
reeks with the stench of rotting flesh.  The eastern wall is home to a
painting depicting a cave of small minotaurs.  As the cold continues to fill
your body, you feel pulled to the south.

E painting~
This painting would nearly blend into the wall with its dull and dark
colors, but it is made very visible by its intricate frame.  Drab though it
may be, the figures in the painting are sharply rendered.  It depicts a
large cave filled with very young minotaurs, all crowded around a small
being.  Covered with blood so early in their young lives, these minotaurs
are shown in their most belligerent state.  The small figure they crowd
around appears to be a Sidhe still grasping onto the last threads of life. 
Badly beaten, the small creature lies helplessly in the hands of the brutes.
~
E hellhound~
The image of the large beast covers most of the floor in this room.  Its
jaws hang open displaying large bloody fangs designed only to inflict pain. 
Sharp spikes cover its back and its tail ends in a barbed hook.  Crimson
eyes stare blankly back, knowing nothing except blood and death.  The feral
animal's fur ranges from shades of dark gray to pitch black.  Its face
frozen in a permanent snarl, its body poised to strike, the image of this
beast serves as the symbol of Carantoc.

The Grand Altar~
Glowing a fierce red that illuminates the entire room, an intricate altar
rises directly from the floor.  The walls here bear no candles, but glow
with the same blood-red light.  Behind the altar, corpses seemingly human
rot on thick wooden pikes.  The aroma of death is palpable in the air,
enticing you into its sickly sweet embrace.  Covering the floor completely
is a pool of blood, gleaming in the light from the altar.  A dripping sound
draws your attention towards a ledge above the eastern wall.  Rows of teeth
meet your gaze as you look into the mouths of voracious hellhounds leaning
over the ledge, blood slowly dripping from their teeth.  Embossed into the
southern wall is a horned visage, grinning sardonically.  Its eyes glow with
a fire brighter than the altar.  The face belongs to a minotaur or a demon,
but you cannot tell which.  Only the blood-red light escapes this room,
rushing to the north.

The Corrupted Fane~
The two walls of this room contrast starkly, the western covered with
weapons and the southern covered by a bookshelf.  Weapons of every
classification, each dripping with blood, hang from the western wall.  Its
racks contain freshly-bloodied swords, axes, flails, whips, and several
implements you can only imagine are used for torture alone.  Seeming far
more mundane than the western wall, the southern wall is mostly covered by a
large bookshelf.  What you can see of it is inscribed with strange magical
runes and icons.  Covering the shelf are hundreds of books and tomes, their
paper yellowed with age.  The books seem free of dust, though a smeared
reddish substance is evident on many of them.  The combined smells of aged
paper and fresh corpses assault your nose.  As you look over the room, the
distinct taste of blood fills your mouth.  A strange cold fills you, coaxing
you eastward.

A Small Burial Chamber~
Evenly-spaced candles spread around the room illuminate the burial
chamber much more than the hall.  A huge stone sarcophagus in the center
dominates the room.  Rising from the lid of the sarcophagus, a gold-trimmed
visage surveys the room.  A beautiful woven tapestry covers a majority of
the floor, with the stone only showing at the far edge.  The sequence of
candles on the walls ceases for a stretch to allow for a portrait,
presumably of the deaceased.

An Exceedingly Large Burial Hall~
Doubling the dimensions of the hallway outside, this room expands over
your head and to your left and right.  To the north, you can barely glimpse
a huge monument of some sort in the distance.  Immense light rushes in from
the northeast, its source too distant to identify.  Thick, soft, rugs cover
the floor and dance into intricate patterns and designs.  The room expands
in all directions except south, which leads back to the comparatively
mundane altar room.

Before a Collection of Portraits~
Cold gazes and harsh stares regard you from both of the walls.  Large
portraits line both walls, six in total, each of their faces eerily similar.
Small plaques under each portrait bear the name of the Wyndham portrayed. 
All the portraits are framed with well-finished wood and have thick glass
over them.  Barely visible beams of light from the east provide illumination
as they weave around a massive object.  A faint dusty smell emanates from
the south.

You see from the plaque that the portraits run left to right along the
walls in descending familial order.  Oddly, no dates are given.  The plaque
inscriptions, in order:

Lord Jaime Wyndham II

Under a Bright Skylight~
Despite the darkness that envelops the surrounding area, shadows seem not
exist under this skylight.  Light explodes from seemingly all directions,
becoming almost tangible as it is focused into beams.  A large crystalline
chandelier hangs down from under the skylight, bending and twisting the
light.  A closer look at the skylight reveals strange markings scratched
into the glass.  They seem to serve as a runic ward of sorts.  Squinting,
you notice the scratches are on the outside.  Perhaps they serve to keep
evil out...or to keep it in.

ALTDESC 0 The Light of Rebirth~
 Brilliantly sparkling white light floods the room from seemingly all
directions, rendering you momentarily blind.  As your eyes adjust to the
brightness, you find yourself in a small shrine illuminated by what must be
thousands of candles.  A tiny alcove in the eastern wall contains a small
statue, perhaps three feet tall.  Because of the brightness afforded by the
candles, it takes you a moment to notice the crystalline chandelier and
skylight directly above you.  Little moonlight seems to come from either,
the majesty of the candles too overpowering.
