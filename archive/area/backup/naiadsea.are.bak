A beautiful beach, forming the shape of a crescent moon, stretches
out from the edge of the woods.  Deep, red sand lends an air of
relaxation to this utopian setting.  The water, in sharp contrast,
to the sand, starts out as a brilliant green, then turns to a
beautiful shade of turquoise all the way to the horizon.  A few
islands can be seen far into the distance.

A Bed of Kelp~
A massive bed of seaweed drifts along with the currents,
completely obliterating any view of the ocean depths.
Nothing dares go near it for fear of becoming entangled.

The Naiadian Sea~
Gentle swells, no more than two feet in height, rise up and down
in a gentle rythm.  The water is a brilliant shade of turquoise,
so crystal clear it almost seems like you can see the bottom.
Here and there, small pieces of seaweed can be seen floating on
the waters surface.

The Naiadian Sea~
Diamond-like sparkles ripple across the turquoise water, dazzling
the eyes with its brilliance.  Dark shapes, large and small, can
be seen darting beneath the water's surface.  Some shapes are
clearly distinguishable as fish, while others just appears as
dark blurs moving to and fro.

The Naiadian Sea~
Crystal clear, turquoise water rises gently up and down, teeming
with life.  A large school of fish can be seen dashing about
a short distance below the surface, its sheer mass turning the
water black.  A large piece of seaweed drifts along the surface,
bobbing up and down in the gentle waves.
