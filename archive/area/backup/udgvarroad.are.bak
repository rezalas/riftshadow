A Worn Trail, Before the Gates of Iseldheim~
This trail is really just a worn area that wanders through this deolate
plain of parched earth.  Furrows and cracks run along the ground, the
thirsty land gaping at the sky in its plea for water.  Here and there short,
leathery plants spring up from the ground, the sole survivors of this
hostile land.  A city rises up to the east, and the trail continues to the
west.
