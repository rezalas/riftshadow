An Alcove~
This alcove looks to be carved out by hand.  There are many
pelts and hides lining the wall, and the heavy stench of blood
lingers.  You see what looks to be a huge skull attached to
the ground at the base of the wall.  There is a torch on both sides,
and what seems to be a pickaxe carved in the wall.
