formian larva~
a formian larva~
A large, bloated mass of moving flesh lies here, waiting to be fed.
~
Writhing in mucas, dirt, and only the gods know what else, the larvae of
the Formian are both well protected and well tended. They are the future of
the Formian, the power that will bring the chaotic world into control.
Believing that, and seeing this fleshy worm are two things on opposite
poles.

formian worker~
a formian worker~
An abnormally large ant stands here, digging furiously at the walls.
~
Standing to roughly the size of a small dog, this formian worker works
continuously without complaint. Deep red tinted armor protects it more
from the environment than from attacks, it still could hinder blade and
similiar strikes as well. Its front claws look more as though they are
more evolved to dig, rather than fight. Raised from larvae, this giant
insect has no hope of becoming anything else, and will live its life as
only a mere worker.

formian warrior~
a formian warrior~
A human-sized ant patrols the caverns, seeking both intruders and slaves.
~
Standing as tall as almost five feet in height, this giant insect looks to
be a cross between a centaur and giant ant. A dark red exoskeleton protects
this warrior from intruder attacks as easily as most versions of
platemail. Large pincer-like hands look ready to render the flesh from
bone easily, or could be used to minuplate other weapons just as well; a 
set of large mandibles protrude from the insects mouth, easily used as a 
weapon as well.

Armed with a mean temper and an even meaner weapon, this large Formian has
been left in charge of the slaves. A dark red exoskeleton protects this
formian from intruder attacks as easily as most versions of platemail.
Large pincer-like hands look ready to render the flesh from bone easily,

A large bloated mass rests here, moving only to deposit yet another egg.
~
Bloated beyond comprehension, this large mass of flesh and mucas looks 
horrifying to the extreme. Her legs look as though they have not been used 
ever, and occasionally twitch at random. Her bloated form never moving 
from the royal chambers renders her vunerable, as she is more commanding
orientated than fighting.

goblin captive~
a goblin captive~
Working on the tunnel, this smelly little goblin performs only half-heartedly.
~
Looking very unkept, even by goblin standards, this particular goblin
seems to have lost pretty much all will. Tattered rags barely covers its
very bruised flesh, though it is very hard to distinguish through the dirt
and sweat. Its glazed over eyes give the impression of resignation,
something the goblinoid races have been known to do quite quickly.

wafts from the interior of the caverns, leaving a musty smell in its wake.
North lies the cavern entrance, while south leads back towards the plains.
East and west are blocked by the walls of the mountain cleft.

Inside the Cave Mouth~
Breaching the side of the mountain, a cool crisp breeze rushes at you. In
its wake, it leaves a mixture of smells that remind you of unwashed bodies
and mold. The air in the immediate area seems to be reaching a stable,
cool temperature as well. Even this short distance into the mountain, you
already have the sense of thousands of tons of stone, rock and dirt
overhead. Southward, a faint light glimmers and you can almost hear the
birds chirp, while eastward the tunnel continues it's ancient trek inward.

A Bend in the Tunnel~
Following the path intently, you come across a sharp turn. South, the air
seems to be a bit fresher, if only a little. East, the darkness consumes
the area completly.

Inside the Caverns~
The atmosphere has reached a cool, consistant temperature here. The dark
has completly engulfed everything, save the glimmer of the west. as well.
The tunnel is big enough for two to three titans standing abreast, leaving
enough space for plenty of elbow room. To the north, the tunnel slowly
continues its journey inward under the mountain.

A branch in the tunnel~
The cavern walls in this area seem smooth, and worn with erosion. Various
vegetation has been strung about, places where animals deemed that this was
an appropriate spot for their den. A light scraping noise can be heard from
the echoes from both the north and east of here, while the south holds a
faint trace of fresh air.

A T-intersection~
Completely engulfed by mountainous rock, the small cavern has left all 
traces of the outside world behind. The feeling of thousands of tons of 
rock all around gives off the feeling of clostrophobia. The rock is smooth 
and worn to the east and south, while to the west it seems a bit more 
rougher than natural erosion. A heavily treaded path runs east and western 
in direction, a few fresh tracks showing strange prints in the dust.
