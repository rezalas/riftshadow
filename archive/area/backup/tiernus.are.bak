E worn~
This small, unobtrusive altar sits in a small alcove in the northern wall
of the cavern.  Ancient, and obviously untended in centuries, it seems to be
little more than a relic from a bygone age.  As you look closely at the
relief, you can barely make out an image of a jackal, facing a larger
predator.  As you watch, the scene seems come to life until you pull your
but sense an immense power emanating from the altar, making you wonder if
perhaps this altar isn't as abandoned as it seems.

A Sheltered Copse~
Stumbling across a sudden turn in the trail, you find yourself within a
hidden copse of trees.  Above you, the trees sway calmly in the wind, but
down within the grove itself, an odd stillness prevails.  A few small
animals scurry about, but even their movements hardly rustle the foliage. 
As you survey your surroundings, a dark area beyond the eastern edge of the
grove catches your attention.

Within a Small Cave~
As your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cave, you find yourself
feeling somewhat uneasy, though you cannot place why.  The silence of the
grove is somehow increased here, and even the sounds of your footsteps are
quickly hushed.  In the darkness, it is difficult to see beyond a few feet,
forcing you to look with painstaking detail as you try to proceed.

Before a Worn Shrine~
By the far wall of the cave, you see a ancient, worn altar, looking
untended for centuries.  The walls of the cave, however, glow with a dim
light, allowing you to see unaided.  Near the far wall, you notice a worn,
ancient altar that looks untended for centuries.  Under the light of the odd
glow, you see little else within the cavern.

Deep Within the Mountain~
Within a small, dark cave, deep within Mount Cim, you can't help but feel
somewhat claustrophobic.  The rough, rugged walls of the cave make it
obvious that this is some sort of natural cavern, though the nearby cavern
seems somewhat odd...

The Sanctuary of Jathruk~
A dim glow emanating from the walls of the cavern give this entire cavern
an eerie, unnatural glow, just bright enough to let you see.  The cavern
itself is quite large, and though the walls bear no signs of ever being
worked, they are perfectly smooth, and give the feeling they were somehow
designed to be this way.
