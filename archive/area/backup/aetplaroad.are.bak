A Road Through the Fields~
To the north and south extend huge fields, the long grasses rippling
faintly with the passing breeze.  Beyond the fields to the north some
rolling foothills sprout up in the distance.  Far to the south a walled city
is barely visible.  This dirt track stretches out through the fields to the
east, where the plains seem to become even more expansive.  An intersection
of roads lies to the west.

An Intersection in the Plains~
This intersection is little more than an elliptical patch of dirt carved
out among the fields of high grasses.  Off to the east, the road grows
narrow as it makes its way into a forest which rises out of the plain.  The
dirt track also continues to the west, and to the north the grasses have
been trampled down to form a path leading through the plains.

A Road Near the Forest~
The dirt track stretching through this area is narrow, but well-traveled.
To the north and south, plains stretch out into the horizon, long grasses
swaying gently in the breeze.  The road continues to the west here toward a
small intersection, and runs also to the east where a small village sits in
the shadow of a larger forest.

A Road Near the Forest~
The narrow dirt track is somewhat shaded here, as it approaches a small
village to the east.  To the southeast a rather large forest looms above the
village.  The dirt road runs to the west, where vast plains stretch out to
the north and south.  Stretching into the horizon, the prospect of
civilization seems more likely beyond the plains to the west.
