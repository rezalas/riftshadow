Chopping meat at an almost frantic pace, this fat, red-cheeked man sweats

the side of his head, and both the sound of his heavy breathing and the

Wearing tattered rags and a few other strange articles of scavenged
clothing, this beggar sits here and shouts out at passing people.  His hair
is grayish, covering his head and face, but his gums are horribly rotten and
browned, so that when he calls out for alms, an awful stench escapes his
dried and cracked lips.

Very wiry and somewhat filthy looking, Deggil is known or known of by
most of the citizens of Melcene (for better or for worse).  The filth and
cheapness of his tavern somehow combine with its age to create an odd sort
of comfort, bringing him local fame with which he manages to make a small
fortune off of the lower class of the city.  His black hair is mottled with
gray, and covers his arms and legs thoroughly.  His tunic is stained with
various alcoholic beverages, and the black short pants that he wears are
covered in something greasy.

His thick, bushy eyebrows are connected, forming a single brow that spans
across his forehead.  His thick black hair forms a tangled mass on top of
his head and covers his face as well.  His arms are also almost freakishly
hairy, but he smiles a lot!

An angry-looking duergar constantly grumbles and insults those belonging to his guild.
~
Covered in the thick greasy hair that duergar are infamous for being
covered with, this dark-dwarf impatiently teaches and bosses around numerous
warrior aspirants.  Wielding a heavy club in one large hand and a broadsword
in the other, he illustrates the finer points of being a warrior in a very
physical manner.

A short woman speaks with customers and cautiously handles gold.
~
A large mole and a few lines of anxiety marr her otherwise attractive
face, and the dulled look of one who is doing a job that they are used to is
spread across it.  A couple of her curly brown locks hang down in front of
her face, the rest tied back as to not get in her way.  Her clothes are
common with the exception of a brightly-colored tunic to indicate that she
works here at the bank.

(The streets of Tokyo, daytime. Hiro, a happy and stylish teenager lays back on a bench, smiling
contentedly.)
Hiro: Ah, the sun is so warm and happy today. I just hope it doesn't get any hotter!

Hiro: Wow! Uh, who are you?
Sakuya: I'm Sakuya, and I'm late for class!
Hiro: (Rubbing the back of his neck) Uh, it's good to meet you Sakuya!
Sakuya: Well, we haven't really met yet, because I don't know your name you silly boy!

Hiro: (Blushing brighter) Ha ha! Yes, see you around Sakuya!

Shining Lucky Moon Jesus Cube No. 7: Magical Girl Collection Plus
 
(Scene: Tokyo at midnight: the moon shines down upon the building that houses the mega
corporation, Akayatech.)
 
Woman's voice: Sometimes I wonder what things wait for me behind the moon.
Things that are warm and full of love like a mother's embrace...
Or things that are cold like the icy grip of death...
I would like to believe that the moon hides the mystery of happiness, but
its light shows things at night that are so painful that I cannot truly
believe this. For now, I must only sleep... sleep and dream that one day, my
skill of dreaming becomes so developed that I may answer the question of happiness
and despair: the question of the moon.
 
(Scene: In Sakuya[Susan Sarandon]'s bedroom, where she lies tossing and turning in bed.)
 
Sakuya: Oh, no! Not... Not...! Don't come after me again, nooooooo!
 
* Ashi, Sakuya's adopted father runs into the room to see what is wrong.
Ashi: Sakuya, are you alright!? Sakuya, wake! Wake and answer me, Sakuya!
Sakuya: Oh... Oh... (waking up) It... It was terrible, but it was only a dream.
It was only a terrible dream.  But sometimes I wonder if it means something, or if
my dreams are just driving me crazy!
Ashi: Ah, Sakuya, dreams hide the truth sometimes, but just as often you can find your
dreams being realized if you try hard enough, or don't try hard enough to prevent them.
Are you alright?

The people meandering down the road are a mixed lot of people.  Tourists make
up the majority of those walking toward the Glass Tower, while messengers and
members of assorted guilds move in both directions.  The tower itself casts
long shadows across parts of the street, its presence dominating the entire
city of Melcene.  Few citizens roam along this portion of the city, as little

Large groups of tourists stand in awe at the large structure that towers over
them.  A magical aura pulses from its very presence, making some of the

The smell of fresh stew lingers in the air as it wafts from the small pot
hanging over the northern fireplace.  It seems like a strange commodity to
have inside a chapel such as this, but even such a simple meal can truly be
heavenly to the homeless that beg outside the doors.  A small wooden altar
rests near the southern wall, a few blankets and loaves of bread waiting to
be donated to the needy at its feet.

Within the Anti-Paladins' Guild~
The insides of the building are shady and rough, looking more like a tavern
in a dangerous part of the city rather than a guild.  The northern wall sports
a beat up bar, half empty barrels slumped along side like old men at a watering
hole.  A few broken stools have been tossed carelessly to one side of the
guild, evidence that even those who claim to work on the same side cannot be
trusted.

Within the Assassins' Guild~
Shadows rise and fall with the flickering of torches inside this large and
dirty cavern.  It looks as if it could crumble and cave in at any moment, but
despite this fact, numerous dark clad figures peer out from the darkness.  A
few stools are set off to one corner, out of the way of any skirmishes that
might occur.  A small ladder leads back up to the surface, through a small
hole in the ceiling.

Within the Thieves' Guild~
Darkness consumes much of the guild hall with the exception of a few well
placed torches.  Shadows move with surprising agility until they approach the
entrance, when it can be seen that they aren't shadows at all, but members of
the guild. The walls, floors, the entire hall has been picked clean of anything
that might be deemed valuable, and even some of the thieves here are eyeing up
each others' things.

many different views preached in one guild, the bickering and fighting
occurs so frequently as to have become commonplace.

The strange black tower here looks to have been formed out of one single piece
of volcanic glass, its surface smooth and shiny.  Aside from the tower's
coloring and size, it bears the closest resemblance of all the mage guilds in
Melcene to the Glass Tower.  A few words appear perfectly engraved near the
arched doorway, the reflective glass making it only visible when viewed from

Within the Necromancers' Guild~
An almost unbearable stench clings to the air inside the tower.  The walls are
a glossy black stone much like the exterior of the structure, and the few
candles and various other light sources reflect off the wall's surfaces.  The
few tables and chairs in the guild seem to be made of the same material as the
tower itself, their every surface unblemished and smooth.  A small stairway is
tucked away in the corner of the guild, leading higher.

Kaful's Sandwich Hut~
This building is far from well-built, and in addition, it's far from
clean.  Paint is cracking off of some of the walls -- along with the
plaster.  The scent that fills the room, however, is amazingly appetizing. 
Meats, spices, cheeses and vegetables all are on display here.  Bread is
being baked and various meats are being cooked freshly.

Within a Large Tent~
This tent is extremely large, and a number of mercenaries sit around
watching potential clients enter.  Patches cover up ripped spots in the tent
poorly, and the scent of sweat and something stagnant lingers in the air. 
The opening of the tent is to the west, out which lies the streets of
Melcene.

An Inn Room~
This room is surprisingly quiet, considering the loud, buzzing streets of
Melcene are but a few feet away from you at the most.  The windows of this
room are closed, and the bed in here is soft and clean.  The floor is made
of brown wooden planks, and is quite solid, having ground just beneath it. 
The walls are smooth and cream-colored, giving the room a feeling of warmth.

A Cozy Inn~
The colors in this place are dull and muted.  Thick candles are placed
here and there, releasing a spicy cinnamon scent into the air along with
providing a soft, warm light to the room.  A counter sits about four feet
away from the western wall.  Doors lead to the north and south into smaller
rooms, a comfortable bed visible in each.

An Altar of Neutrality~
Smooth limestone composes the walls and altar of this branch of the
Temple of Melcene.  Muted pastel colors make up the room, not too bright,
nor too dark.  The attempt to convey this place as a center of balance was
not a subtle one.  An altar of stone with gold and silver designs sits in
the center of the room, and to the south lies the large main chamber.

An Altar of Darkness~
Three candles set up behind the altar provide the only light in this
room: an eerie glow that flickers slowly, illuminating and reflecting off of
the golden altar.  Odd yet lavish engravings cover the altar's surface, and
demonic statues crouch and huddle in the shadows, given life by the infernal
candles that shine down upon them.  Back to the west, the more comfortable
main chamber of the temple awaits you.

The Main Chamber of the Temple of Melcene~
The main chamber of the temple is quite large, and constructed from
smooth limestone.  Vases have been placed on the ground all around the room,
each engraved and painted with different designs.  To the west, the ground
slopes up, and some bright lights and hints of the colors blue and gold are
visible.  To the east, the ground slopes down and into darkness, and to the
north, the even ground continues into a room that is not unlike this one.

An Altar of Light~
Bright, airy light flows into this beautiful chamber from unnatural
sources.  The walls are covered with tapestries of blue and gold, and in the
center of the room lies a plain altar of stone.  A number of offerings have
been placed here and there about this altar, most of them are sweet-smelling
herbs, food or drink.  Some gold also lies here as a sacrifice, undisturbed
by other visitors.

The Sailing Stone~
Good food and drink abound in this tavern.  The polished wooden bar
supports a number of glasses filled with beers and booze, along with
assorted dried fruits and other snacks.  Common-folk along with a few
adventurers here and there sit around casually and speak to each other over
their drinks, while serving girls hurry about the room to keep everyone
happy, full and drunk.  A door leads out of this room and to the west, into
another room that exudes a different sort of excitement, while out the
northern door lie the streets of Melcene.

A Gambling Room~
A bunch of men and women are huddled together around various tables in
this room.  The scent of sweat mingles with the scent of food and drink that
wafts in from the east as the excitement and tension that fills the air
takes its toll on the bodies and minds of the gamblers in this room.  A door
leads back into the main room of the tavern to the east.

A Bank~
Well lit by candles and torches, this windowless building houses most of
Melcene's gold.  People walk in and out under the scrutiny of the bank
tellers and guards, who watch for anyone or anything suspicious.  The floor
is totally bare, and Melcene's usually extravagant atmosphere does not seem
to penetrate this spartan room.

The Open Barrel~
This shanty of a tavern is composed primarily of a hard, dark wood,
stained by grease and assorted alcoholic beverages.  Cheap sketches of
dwarves are hung up around the room crookedly, and the cramped walls lean in
slightly, warped by the weather outside.  A couple of tables have been
placed around the room, but neither of them are completely free of food,
though both of them are currently unoccupied.  In an unoccupied table near
the back of the bar, there is a very shady looking statue of a man with two
faces.

A Back Room~
The presence of unopened crates dominates most of the space in this storage
area, though it's hard to tell from its current state of chaos.  It's a wonder
that anything can be found at all, as nothing appears to be labeled.  Strangely
enough, the smokey scent of incense fills the air, making it all the harder to
discern much of anything inside.

All sorts of magical trinkets and statues line the back wall of this strange

can be found sold in this small, tourist attracting shop.  From the plush decor
of the shop itself, the owner appears to be doing quite well in regards to the
business side of things.  Most things sold here are reasonable in price to keep
the visitors buying, but a few more expensive items are displayed in case of
thick glass.

It would be rare to find a mage at this particular spot in the city, as
in general, mages tend to be the richer element in this city, along with the
merchants.  Here is where many of the poor, desperate folk who have become
ill, diseased or cursed have set up camp, hoping to attract the attention of
a particularly merciful healer entering or exiting his or her guild to the
east.

walls, the passerbys are overcome with a sense of reassurance as they travel on.

Rough black stone has been stacked up to form an ugly sore of a building.  Its
square doorway is dim and uninviting, and the grim, angry looks worn on
members' faces as they pass in and out isn't very promising.  The stone of the
doorway is chipped in many places, suggesting that some of the fights haven't
made it much further.

toss anything here over the edge at any given time.

A Trail To The Cliff~
Sparse grasses and brush have been beaten back over time by the passage of
many  travelers hoping to catch a glimpse of the sea's unmatchable beauty.
More rocky terrain takes over the ground with every step closer to the cliff,
as if to warn of the dangerous conditions that standing at the edge entails.
Nothing seems to stir along the trail, insects and four-legged wildlife
content to remain hidden for now.

Thick-leaved trees and the full undergrowth shelter all sounds of the city and
sea from the tunnel-like passage.  The trail itself is rather hard to find,
what with the natural surroundings blocking out most of the light that would

one, cushioned by a lush layer of grass that manages to grow here despite the

Overlooking The Sea~
The waters below crash against the side of the cliff violently, impressing on
the fact that this is not a calm ocean.  The surroundings on the cliff are just
as impressive, trees looming to form a small shelter.  A few wild flowers grip
the soil, intent to remain despite the winds that whip up from the unruly sea.
A few boulders have been carved out to make a bench to make the onlookers more

The Gate of Melcene~
The gates of Melcene are carved from a single, large chunk of solid
granite.  Designs, patterns and symbols have been carved all the way through
the gates and replaced by pieces of dark, opaque and smooth glass, the
colors contrasting greatly with the gray granite.  Merchants and commoners
mingle within the crowd of people entering and exiting the city, as the
guards placed here attempt to sort out the incoming visitors and outgoing
denizens of the great city of Melcene.

The Infinite Treasury~
Descending the stairs from the grimy bar above, you are frozen in shock
as you see what must be the largest concentration of wealth in Shalar. 
Priceless antiques line the room; the walls cannot be seen beneath the
layers upon layers of exquisite tapestry.  Strings of gems are strewn
haphazardly about, and the floor itself gleams with the dull shine of some
unidentifiable, yet precious metal.  Sliding upon rows of beautiful
paintings, your eyes fall upon the most gaudy, valuable thing you have ever
seen.  A platinum altar of a man with two faces, covered in diamonds,
rubies, and pearls sits atop a raised dais.  There is a small bowl made of
pure gold made to hold offerings.

Zheas Road~
A somewhat different clientele inhabits this portion of Melcene, the guilds
of all sorts kinds of trades taking up residence closer to the magical heart of
the city.  The bustle of traffic has thinned out through here, yet the tension
increases with every accidental meeting of enemies.  Here and there a merchant
will pass by offering wares or a citizen will scurry past, running daily
errands. For being inside a city built around magic, it seems odd that nary a
mage passes through here.

A strange feeling fills the air in this portion of Melcene.  Men and women
pass by, adorned in robes and gowns as if they were a part of some royal court.
Very few citizens or merchants make their way along the street as the district
is regarded as one of great importance.  Groups of gawking visitors stroll past
occasionally, however, taking in the sight of the towering home to the Scions.
The street itself seems to swirl and eddy, mystical energies tingling beneath

Alesh Road~
A strange feeling fills the air in this portion of Melcene.  Men and women
pass by, adorned in robes and gowns as if they were a part of some royal court.
Very few citizens or merchants make their way along the street as the district
is regarded as one of great importance.  Groups of gawking visitors stroll past
occasionally, however, taking in the sight of the towering home to the Scions.
The street itself seems to swirl and eddy, mystical energies tingling beneath
a clear, solid seal.

The people meandering down the road are a mixed lot of people.  Tourists make
up the majority of those walking toward the Glass Tower, while messengers and
members of assorted guilds move in both directions.  The tower itself casts
long shadows across parts of the street, its presence dominating the entire
city of Melcene.  Few citizens roam along this portion of the city, as little

Approaching a Great Tower~
Large groups of tourists stand in awe at the large structure that towers over
them.  A magical aura pulses from its very presence, making some of the
resident mages even stop and stare with wonder.  The air is heavy with silence,
those who are visitors and those who are citizens well aware of how important
the studies inside the tower truly are.
