dryad~
a dryad~
A dryad peers at you inquisitively from behind her tree.
~
With her slim fingers she holds her tree protectively as she looks at
you, her brown eyes full of innocence and curiosity.  As you approach
her she looks startled and disappears into the tree, only to appear on
the other side of it moments later to smile at you shyly.  The dryad
is just slightly taller than 5 feet and has the eternally beautiful
and youthful features of the faerie folk.

nymph~
a nymph~
A nymph looks coyly at you, then winks mischeviously and dances away.
~
Her long hair is wet, as if just splashed with the waters of a crystal
brook or stream.  Her movements are full of grace and wild abandon as
she dances along the forest path.  You hear laughter like the sound of
running water and you cannot be sure if it is her singing or a brook
in the distance.  She calls out to you to join her in her dance.

a pixie~
A small pixie stands here laughing cheerfully.
~
A small, knee high little pixie looks really engrossed with the
activities of the pixie-brownie Bonanza. Not believed to exist by
most of the normal folk of Shalar, he is clad in soft green leathers
and cloth and wears a small cap with a proud rooster feather sticking
out. Not looking at them directly, he seems to be eyeing one of the
brownies.

There is a cheerful brownie here chatting merrily away.

This brownie seems totally oblivious to your presence, and she seems
quite happy to continue chatting merrily to her friends. Slightly
shorter than pixies, the brownies have a reputation of wit and
cheeriness with a touch of mischief. Like most brownies, she has
pretty elvin features, and is dressed totally in brown. She wears
no cap, her otherwise long hair tied in a pony-tail.

Iachimo the Dour Spriggan hides behind a tree grinning maliciously.
~
Iachimo is a spiteful prankster who often annoys the residents of the
Emerald Forest.  He sets fires at the roots of trees, poisons the
streams and bites the pixies and brownies.  He doesn't have a good
bone in his spindly body and the forest would be well rid of him.
He unleashes a torrent of curses at you.

one individual formally known as "The Chairman of the Great Feast
and Festival" but is usually referred to as the 'Grand Pooh-Ba' by
most of the participants. This particular Pooh-Ba seems to have a
bit of halfling blood in him, for he towers almost a head over the
pixies and brownies. He is dressed in large and flowing green-brown
robe, and seems rather busy with his duties.

the vale village doesn't have many strangers and so they are largely
spared the tricksters or thieves of the larger towns. Her basket is
full of delicious looking apples and pears.

    In the silent night
    I murmur'd my fears

    To seek for new Joy

Before you is the famed knight of the Order of the Bleeding Hearts,

It's not the sort of whining self-flagellation type insecurity or
self-pity, but a strange and deep "sorrow" which they all seem
burdened with. The Sorrow of God, perhaps? Nobody really knows save
the members of the order.

A gaunt apparition in priests' robes turns sadly towards the lake.

This must be the ghost of Brother Alandro, the priest of Saint
Sebastian's abbey who succumbed to his vanity and challenged the
witches.  His strength proved less than his faith in himself and his
spectre now wanders the edge of this dark lake forever.

Cutting runes into the bark of a tree is a wild-looking elfin girl.
~
She is a lithe creature with impish features, dressed in flamoyantly
colored rags.  Her braided hair seems a mass of green serpents, but
perhaps it's simply its wildness turning in the wind.  She looks at
you sharply and for a moment, you see upon her face the image of
smiling demon.

Imbessar~
Imbessar the Bandit King prepares for his last duel.
~
Imbessar is a brutish giant of man. Years ago he stole the Dead Star
Circlet from the temple of Yog-Sothoth at Nag'Yrn, and has since
crossed three worlds fleeing the vengeance of the dead god's acolytes.
Weary of the endless flight, he has chosen to make his last stand here
in the sanctuary of the Emerald Forest. As he whips about to face you,
you see that ages of paranoia and fear have moulded a defiant snarl
permanently on his scarred face.

This is a disgusting little gremlin, with long crooked ears, a slimy
green sticky body and a grin so wide you feel like tossing a few
stones into it. It hops around making irritating noises, and looks
like it would like to do you some harm and is thinking of it to. It's
got 'kill me now' written all over it's forehead in every possible
language known.

 "O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight;
  Or, if they have, where is my judgement fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  if it be not, then love doth well denote
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no.
  How can it?  O! how can Love's eye be true,
  That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
  The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
  O cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find."

A Fog-Shrouded Trail~
You are on a fog-shrouded trail which runs up the side of this dark
mountain.  The ground is wet and muddy with melted snow, and the path which
should lead to the shores of the Naiadian Sea disappears amongst the mist
and the trees.  There is nothing for you to do but follow the trail that
twists up towards the broken, snow-covered heights of the mountain range.

The snow begins to fall thickly as you enter a pine forest in the

about a dozen yards off the path.  There is a disconcerting silence
in these woods, an oppressive lifelessness that makes you want to

uncomfortable, you look south, where the forest seems to darken
menacingly.  The east trail beckons you to the safety of the Emerald

Having no time for such adolescent frivolities, you quickly scan the

Your uneasiness mounts as you walk along this haunted stretch of road.
The mist clears, and you find yourself in a nightmarish forest.  The
empty husk of a dead nymph lies at your feet, and on either side of you,
the trees look twisted and tortured into unnatural shapes.  The depths
of the forest sends up a hopeless cry to usher you into the woods that
ring the edge of Hell.

Under Dark Woods~
The path continues darkly under rows of Elder trees.  A crooked road
leads west through a tangled hedge of briars.  A mist prevents you from
looking beyond the hedge, but you sense a powerful and oppressive evil
reaching out towards you with cold and clawed fingers.  To the south,
the forest seems to lighten considerably, and you are about to leave
in that direction when a tattered parchment, flapping weakly in the
wind, falls at your feet.

E parchment~
(Parchment: It is yellowed and seems savagely ripped from a tome.
 "... I mouthed a prayer for my fallen brother Alandro as I raised his
  morning-star to smite the foul witch who had struck him down.  But I
  had reckoned without her Sisters, and the twain now flew shrieking
  towards me.  The first, diabolically transformed, pinioned me to the
  ground, while her corrupt breath drove the sight from my eyes and
  caused boils to burst from my skin.  The other, whom I had seen to be
  beautiful but terrible even as I was made blind, wrested my weapon
  from me and tore at my face.  I know not how I fled from their cursed
  abode, but the relief I felt then at my escape was vainly felt, for
  even now, I nightly suffer the torments of their evil blandishments.
  In my sleep I see myself being chased at the edge of a black abyss by
  the Devil's huntsmen and their hellhounds slavering for my soul.  I
  wake up drained, I feel both my faith and my sanity slipping from me.

  We had been foolishly proud, thinking we could destroy those servants
  of evil alone.  Now we are undone, and the relic of our Holy Saint is
  lost forever.")

A circle of blue-capped mushrooms form an old faerie ring by the side
of the path you are on.  On certain nights of the year, the faerie folk
wander out into such rings for wild dances by the moonlight.  It is
said that mortals who are drawn into the dancing circle on such nights
can be held captive by faerie food or a faerie's kiss and made to dance
on and on for a period of seven years.  You hear a titter of laughter
from the branches of a tree, but when you look up you see nothing.

You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that
you have ever laid eyes on.  It has gold-flecked leaves that are the
size of small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that
is easily twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights
of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You
see movement and lights in and about the tree, but there seems to be
no way you can get closer to it.

has long black hair and elfin features, a yew bow slung across her back.

silver oak trees stands a likeness of Altariel, the Lady of the Woods.
At the base of the waterfall, a rock pool with crystal clear water has

in the Emerald Forest. There are clear passages to the north, west
and east, while the path to the south abruptly ends at the foot of a
sheer cliff face, with a wall so smooth that it would be impossible
to climb. A variety of bird song and animal sound fill the air.

A Forest Trail~
The somewhat ragged west-ward forest trail makes a sharp right and
southernly turn here, making further travel to the west difficult
if not impossible, would be safer to backtrack and find another
path instead of hacking through the notoriously resilient trees of the
Emerald Forest. A tall tree with huge leafy branches branches stands
here tempting you to take a break and rest in it's shade.

A Dwindling Forest Path~
The forest path begins to dwindle here.  It's obvious you've entered
a part of the forest seldom visited by anyone.  You notice the richness
of the flora here, with a wider and thicker range of herbs growing in
wild abandon across the ground or in small cul-de-sacs formed at the
roots of the oak trees.  You hear a rustle in the bushes, but staring
intently without trying to look too obvious, you notice nothing.

A Lovely Trail~
You are following a faint north-south trail in the Emerald Forest.
Swallows and Bluebirds fill the air with song and laughter, and you
spy a small red-breast Robin sitting motionless on a branch on one of
the oak trees. The serenity of this forest is amazing, you feel at
peace and safe, as though you just stepped into a fairy tale where
the knights kill all the trolls, and nobody stays hungry. It's hard
not to day dream, walking here.

The Tombstone~
There is something rather peculiar about this part of the Emerald
Forest. A small tombstone sits in the middle of a small clearing.
Carved from a white substance, it's shiny surface reflects what
little sunlight that manages to escape from the umbrella covering
of trees surrounding the grave. Freshly picked flowers lie at the
foot of the tombstone, while strange symbols are lovingly engraved
on it. The strange thing is there are no paths leading from or to the
area, which would puzzle even the most observant elf or ranger. Who
would pick flowers for a lone grave and leave no evidence of passing?

The Wood-Path~
The Wood-path you're following gets more pronounced and used here,
a testimony that the Emerald Forest isn't populated (or at least
explored and travelled) only by it's original furry or buzzing citizens.
Multi-coloured flowers dance gaily in the wind while clinging to the feet
of the tall oak and pine trees flanking the forest road. Flying
squirrels leap from branch to branch, probably searching for a
delicious cashew or two.

Woodkeeper's Clearing~
The path ends in a medium sized clearing. A small wooden sign states
quite dogmatically "WoodKeeper's Clearing. Forest haters not welcomed.
Orcs, Bugbears and Goblins keep out!". A number of elves and humans
dressed in a mixture of green and brown stand around here engaging in
friendly conversation. The actual Keeper's Meet hasn't started yet,
apparently there are rangers from distant woodlands still trying to
make it for the meeting. A pile of scrolls sit on a small table,
probably pamphlets to be distributed to the arriving participants of
the meeting.

The Green Vines~
Thick green vines form an impossible barrier to the south. There is
no reason to doubt that these vines possess the same ability to
block even the most determined machete-armed lumber-dwarf then all
the others. What does seem a bit strange, however, are faint footsteps
leading up to the vines and abruptly stopping. Could they merely be
tracks from an age past, now lost to the world and found only in time
and memory?

The Silent Grove~
You've managed to wander into a small silent grove in the forest.
For some strange reason most of the forest noises seem to have
disappeared, though you can feel the rustle of the leaves beneath
your feet as you walk. The silence isn't really eerie, however, but
more of a contemplative quietness. Small stones are arranged in an odd
fashion on the ground, much the way seating chairs would be arranged
should the speaker be in the middle of a circle. It's almost as though
a little tribe of beavers just had a river-dam guild meeting and have
left for lunch.

sparkling bark. No rotting scent seems to come from it as most

this is a rarely travelled part of the forest even by it's own
standards. A small mouse-deer runs across the trail, followed by
a lazy looking lynx. To the north you can just make out a clearing
through the trees, and there seems to be movement.

Festival, your senses are quickly overloaded with sight, sound
and smell. brownies clad in soft brown cloth with little feathered
hats mingle happily with their slightly smaller and greener cousins,
the forest pixies. An almost musical chitter-chatter fills the
air, while the aroma of freshly baked treats drift in from the
north. There seems to be a forest dweller's competition, what
with the many games the pixies and brownies seem to be playing. A tug
of war is currently in progress, with the heaving brownies having
a slight lead over the grunting pixies.

rest.  A lone thrush sighs from a branch of the tree.  To the west

and cookies. The dozens of eager eaters seem a bit impatient,

white and red flower blossoms. Two stone lions sit on wooden pillars
guarding entrance to the garden, while two jade dragons guard the door
to the hut proper. A small bucket pulled well stands next to a pen of
chickens and ducks who cluck and quack away merrily. Carrots, cabbages
and rice are grown in a medium sized plot of land to the north. There

the pool is, but it must be very deep since you can't see the bottom. There

and ponder things you've put aside, and think on matters you've forgotten.

beautiful painting of a young oriental women dressed in long flowing
silk on one of the walls. Parchments with foreign exotic wordings in

The Ruined Monastery~
Tangled vines of ivy hang down from what remains of the arch-entranced
of this small monastery.  It is ruined beyond repair and seems to have
been abandoned many years ago.  There is a quiet and melancholic silence
in the air.  You notice footprints in the dust that lead west into a
leaf-strewn courtyard and continue into a small chapel.  You notice for
the first time that that area of the monastery seems to have been spared
the dereliction that the rest of the monastery has fallen into.

combination of trees and the old stone walls of the monastery. There
is a serenity and a sense of life and peace, hinting that it is often
used by others as a place of worship or contemplation.

simple stone and wood to others that were more like tethered living creatures
than works of art. Each is illuminated by a flaming blood candle, giving a
