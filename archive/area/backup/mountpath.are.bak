A Steep Path~
A small rocky path has begun up a mammoth of a mountain.  A few steps
away is the base of the mountian.  Around the base is a multitude of small
and medium sized boulders, a very odd colour of gray black.  Gazing upward
there is a small shelf to stand on.  Further than that the moutain is
sprinkled with some powdery snow right before clouds hinder the view.

A Narrow Shelf~
This spot on the ledge has been well used, with what looks to be an
indentation where travelers have passed across to climb upwards.  Though a
noticeable amount of small red moss growing in a crevice between the wall of
the moutain and the floor of the ledge.  Up on the rock wall small dark
rocks serve as noticable footholds to climb up on.  Looking up, there is a
little more powdery snow visible than before towards the top of the
mountain.

#29402
A Narrow Shelf~
A small ledge allows walking almost freely without thought of falling. 
With bits of moss growing here and there on the little ledge, this spot
looks like it's not been used much, unlike the rest of the trail.  Carefully
looking over the ledge there are small boulders resting below, but little
movement from any wildlife.  Though a twittering bird can be heard far off
in the distance.

A Mountain Path~
A well worn trail stretches out to the north in the dark stone.  The
climate has changed quite noticeably for the worse.  The wind has become
sharp and biting, and small flakes of feathery snow are starting to fall all
around.  Small almost black bits of stone rest here and there along the
path, seeming a bit out of place because of their dull, yet noticeable
luster.

A Mountain Path~
Continuing on the path it starts to ascend slightly.  The snowflakes have
become a bit larger, though no less feathery.  The sky has turned a gray
cloudy colour, while the white clouds surrounding the top of the mountain
have become wafty and seem to have moved down a bit.  The small black little
stones continue to sprinkle the path with their odd black shimmer.

A Turn in the Path~
Ascending further, the trail continues on to the east.  A small strange
looking plant grows out of a crack in the mountain wall.  The cold weather
doesn't look to faze it.  The ground is starting to accumulate a little bit
of snow, though most of it melts before it can touch down and take its hold.
The mountain wall has two noticeably different colors to it now, a dark gray
black color, and shimmery black color mixed in.  The shimmery black looks
like the small pebbles that litter the ground.

Rounding the Mountain~
The path is becoming steep as the ascent continues on to the south. 
Movement causes the little black pebbles to roll down the path.  Little is
to be seen around this large wall of massive rock.  Flakes of icy snow
continue to fall, though the sharp wind hurtles most of it away.  There are
some larger stones that look like the odd black pebbles here, but they are
sharp and jagged.

A Mountain Trail~
An abrupt wall is here that looks as if someone had sheered it off on
purpose.  Small noticeable black rocks serve as footholds to climb up the
wall.  More red moss is growing here in the crevice between the rock wall
and floor, as well as another strange looking plant.  The snow has started
to accumulate more on the ground, though it melts before it can touch down
near the moss.

A Mountain Path~
The wind has become ever the more biting, and has begun to blow harder. 
The snow has picked up and is falling heavily now, though it still is not
managing to take hold of the rocky floor.  The ascent continues on to the
west.  Looking out past the mountain the clouds block any kind of view.  No
sounds except the howling wind can be heard anymore, and the occasional fall
of a few jagged rocks down the path.

A Turn in the Path~
Ascending further to the north the path continues on.  The wind has
become relentless in it's howling and sharpness.  The clouds seems to be all
around you obscuring your view any farther than a few feet.  The odd black
rocks roll and skip down the path at the blowing of the wind.  A medium
sized boulder is in the way on the path.  Carefully moving around it will
make the northern pathway accessible.

A Mountain Path~
As the path contiues north, a small cave can be seen to the east.  The
snow is starting to take hold of the rocky floor, and is being swept, little
by little, into the entrance of the cave.  The small black pebbles and
jagged stones aren't moving at the wind's command anymore, but rather are
stuck to the mountain by a thin layer of shiny ice, bringing out their
luster among the white snow even more.

A Small Cave~
A dim light cascades through the opening of the cave from outside.  Small
flurries of snow come in the entrance every now and again, only to melt if
they get any further than a foot or two past the opening.  The wind's
relentless howling has died down, and the temperature is suprisingly warm. 
A larger version of the odd black pebbles and rocks is slightly gleaming in
the back of the cave.

A Narrow Ledge~
Still ascending this ledge barely accomodates the size of your feet.  The
snow flakes have started to turn into hail, and the snow on the narrow ledge
here is thick, but covered in a sheet of ice.  The wind has picked up and
continues its almost deafening howl.  Movement is a terrible task, and the
cold is stinging.  The odd black stones have disappeared under the coating
of snow, though their outline can still be seen.

A Narrow Ledge~
Another abrupt wall is here, starting to be covered by ice.  Barely are
the footholds of black rock visible.  The snow and hail have made a slippery
path here, thick, but deadly if the wrong step is made.  There is less snow
and ice near the spot where the rock wall and ledge meet up.  Some of the
odd black stones are half visible here, due to the minimal shelter from the
wind and snow.

A Snowy Mountain Path~
The ascent has come to an almost abrupt halt.  The stoney floor has
flattened out, but no sign of it can be seen.  There is at least a foot of
snow covering it.  Being above the clouds, there is a gray blue sky to be
seen.  The mountain wall still towers overhead, but not too far.  The wind
is not as violent, but still slightly sharp.  In the distance the sounds of
a city can be heard, particularly the sounds of what seem to be horses
hooves clomping about.

A Turn in the Path~
The snowy ascent has come to an end, now on flat snow and ice.  The snow
is still falling, though it has become fluffy and less icy again.  The wind
picks up every now and again, making a rope bridge in the distance creak and
groan a little.  Some of the larger odd black rocks have become visible
again, shining brighter against the cold white snow.  The sounds of a city
are growing louder, the clank of metal can be heard, ever present over the
sound of hooves.

A Wide Plank-Bridge~
Swaying, the bridge moves unsteadily under weight.  Though the planks
have turned color from the harsh wintery weather the bridge looks well
maintained.  None of the planks are missing, and the rope, serving as
railing and holding the planks together, has been well made.  The gate and
walls of a city are well visible now, even through the steady flurries of
snow.  Even the sounds of grunting from the citizens can be slightly heard
over the wind and clomp of hooves.
