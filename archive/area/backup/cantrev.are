An able peasant toils away at the fields, making furrows and weeding.

The peasant before you works handily to create a growing environment
for the Lord  that they serve.  Dressed in the common wool robes of the

a peasant harvester~
A weary peasant works the fields here, harvesting grain.
~
This peasant is working under the careful eye of the
overseers, and is quickly plucking grain kernels from
the stalks of wheat and barley.  The sweat runs down
into the serf's robes, making the wool that much more
uncomfortable, but the worker continues on.

The peasants that trudge the cornfields are at least granted woolen
robes with sleeves to ease the burns and scratches from the corn
plant leaves and husks.  The serf's face is weary and blank, and

The peasants chosen to work the vineyard are robust as the
others, but chosen for gentleness and coordination, to handle
the grapes with care, in order not to spill their valuable juices
before they reach the winery.  The dull, grey woolen robes that
are the dress of the poor hang like a shroud about the

a bit fatter than they should be.  The avian population also feeds

The rainbow trout that are the dominant species in the river
are aptly named- their scales act as a natural sort of prism,
sending color and light back through the water.
A natural defense mechanism, it makes it harder for flying
or swimming predators to focus on the exact location of the
fish while it is in mid-stream.  Unfortunately, to get
the tasty water insects which comprise its diet, it occasionally
must jump from the stream and expose itself to the air
and danger.

Avarast, sixth of the name and master of his cantrev, is instrumental
in the continued success of the commerce of the region.  His
propensity to simply use slaves and destroy  them when they age
rather than feed a useless body has garnered him quite the profit.
His noble face is free of guilt, but bears a constant scowl, and his
fierce black beard juts out from a jawline that could have once
been fair and respectable.  He is dressed richly,  though less so
than many of his courtiers. He, like his chamberlain, seems gripped
by some unseen malaise.
Shadows seem to dance all about him, seen and yet not visible to the eye.

leans back and flexes his hands, his bow strung and at the ready.

lord man Rothael tall~
the Lord Rothael~
Rothael, master of the southern fief, sits heavily upon his simple throne.
~
The man before you has a noble face, yet it seems creased with worry,
his prematurely grey hair framing a picture of anxiety.  Treasuries
certainly are finite, and the aid of the free rangers is nothing
if not expensive.  His clothing is fairly simple, and he bears
scars along the right side of his jaw.  The lines and crows'
feet on his honest face belie the powerfully corded muscles that
guide his movements, the product of hearty discipline and
the immense motivation of subtle paranoia.

steward castle keeper man guard~
the castle steward~
The castle steward stands near his Lord, glaring wildly with his good eye.
~
A former pirate of the inland bays, the steward reputedly met his Lord
in battle long ago, and was granted mercy by Rothael himself when a stray
quarrel took his eye and nearly killed him outright.  Since then, the
wiry elf before you has sworn allegiance and protected his master for
the long years.  He still bears the tattoos and markings of his clan,
however, and his heritage is impossible to hide, a rare elf among the
humans of the valley.

The members of the court of Lord Avarast hold their position at his
whim and by the value of their own scheming and production within
the fields.  They dress themselves richly and wear gaudy, fake jewelry
to draw attention from their Lord and seek his favor.

a fearsome knight~
A crusading knight of the southern reaches kneels here in quiet prayer.
~
The great man before you is Rothael's trump card, a man drawn to the
struggle against his counterpart in the north by the stench of darkness
that looms from the marshy vineyard all the way past the forest.  He
is a holy warrior, and in abhorrence of slavery, though the protection
of the innocent outweighs political concerns.  Prayers are etched into
his armor and the crest on his shield, and his face shines with purity
and devotion.

The council kept for the preservation and prosperity of the cantrev meets
on every full moon to draw together plans for the coordinated use of
their land and to maximize their efficiency.  The man before you seems
more than a simple mathematician, however.  He is lightly armored, and
carries his weapons with graceful ease.

a red-tailed hawk~
A swift white hawk with red coloring glides through the valley.
~
This fearsome predator finds ample hunting in the lush,
fertile fields that the humans keep in this part of the valley.  The
field mice and rodents are plentiful, and hawk meat is not a delicacy
most humans prefer.  Its compact body and wicked talons serve very well,
and its eyes can spot the tiniest movement from nearly half a mile in
the air.

Small rodents prove quite the irritation to the peasant workers and
their overseers, nibbling at the crops during the night and reducing
the profits to the cantrev Lords.  The specimen before you is barely a

A peasant worker tramples grapes in a huge vat here.
~
This peasant has one striking difference from all the field
workers- the feet of this serf are clean and well-maintained
by the castle soldiers.  The winery workers are given special
quarters inside the keep alongside the warriors, and given
soldiers' rations rather than fend for themselves in the village
or in the wilderness.  Other than that, this worker appears
as do all the rest.

ground gives way into a deep, sucking mud, holding you fast, and
the trees near the narrow entrance groan with protest as their
limbs bend toward the ground, making passage impossible.  Vines
snake out from within the brush, entwining the wiry limbs and
holding them fast.
From within the swamp come chittering noises and shrill howls.

wall.  Several small boulders rest on the ledge, evidence of
past rockslides and erosion.  The ledge affords no protection
from the wind and weather, but does grant a wonderful view of the
grassy valley below.  To the northeast, you glimpse a
waving field of grain crop.

here and there with straw and the occasional piece of trash.  For the most

A wide dirt path~
You stand on a wide dirt side-road that runs east and west just
inside the keep's stone wall.  The bustle of the courtyard is left
far behind you, and up ahead, a large, squat building looms heavily
before you.  You hear guardsmen walking faintly atop the outer wall,
but the high parapet denies any clear view.

tables for gaming, tables for dining, and several vaguely man-shaped
targets painted on the wooden walls for the knife-throwing amusements
and contests that the soldiers so enjoy.  The floor is of hard wood,

A sleeping bay~
This room of the keep is somewhat hard to maneuver in, as strong wooden
bunks line the walls and are placed in even though tight rows in the
middle of the room.  The bay is otherwise unremarkable, having no
furniture, no bookshelves, not even a small altar for the soldiers to
recount their sins upon.  It would follow that Avarast does not condone
learning or religious pursuits much.

hardwood floor is of rich, crushed red velvet, and is trimmed with
golden thread.  Portraits of the Lord's ancestors are carved into the
stone walls in a strange, hollow reverse-bust fashion.  In each such
effigy, a pair of diamonds gleam out from the eyesockets of the
fallen lord, gazing with cold indifference upon their successor from
the House of the Dead.

Workmen can walk around the vat with barely five feet to spare between
the vat and the walls, and overseers' whips can barely reach down far
enough to hit the slaves.  Of course, when the serfs are slow, their
drips of blood merely flavour the wine and give it Avarast's
special touch.

the walls and floor.  Here, answers are gained and punishment is
inflicted.  Here, the innocent and guilty alike are broken in body and
spirit, weeping as children, crying wildly for mercy or death.  The
only god here is Pain, and his worship is found in the tears of the
helpless and the blood of the condemned.

This field has had its grass trimmed and cut extremely short, and all

countless trees blooming and laden with ripe apples dominate the field
in long, neat rows.  The grass is cut short that the peasants may walk
about the orchard gathering the fallen fruit before it rots, as well as
selecting the ripe fruit that still hangs from the trees.

in on itself, though from disasters natural, man-made, or simply the

anyone, its doors long since rotted away.  A badly tarnished silver

You stand in the east end of what must have been a rather large

eaten away or rotted to dust by time's withering hand.  Bits of iron
lay strewn about, and a small pair of candleholders jut out from some of
the rubble.  Burn marks mar the surface of the brickwork inside, and
large holes decorate the floor.  The one solid mark of the place is
a grand wooden staircase that appears to still be functional.

assaults you, relieving the musty dimness of the inner chapel and
its ruined nave.  The forest falls away in every direction before you,
and you can glimpse a large castle to the south, fields to the
northeast, and a similar tower to the one you stand on, far to the
west.  The edges of the tower seem to be crumbling, but you notice
that where you now stand looks to have been a place of private
worship, perhaps a gathering room for the priesthood.

bridge is manned by soldiers and is well maintained, though any fool
can see that keystones placed on each side of the bridge are rigged to
allow the defenders to collapse it.  The vegetation has thinned out
considerably here, which makes life easy for any archers standing

they look to be more for structural reasons that strategic.  The tight
area you now stand in is certainly a good way for the keep's soldiers
to view incoming travellers, as well as a perfect bottleneck for archers
to pick apart an invading force.  The heavy wooden gates stand to the

In the castle courtyard~
Here you stand within the wide, sprawling courtyard of the castle.  All
about you are small, tended gardens belonging to the citizenry, soldiers,
and nobles of the keep.  They provide extra income, sustenance, and
work for any industrious enough soul to care for the grounds, as well as
pay the taxes imposed on each gardener's plot.  All around you, in the
immediate interior of the walls, solid wooden longhouses also stand.  To

You stand in one of the large, stout wooden longhouses that stretch
along the keep's inner stone walls.  Here, there is a large bay for
soldiers to roam about in, tables for personal entertainment or study,
and bunk beds line the walls two rows deep.  The planking and
oil lanterns make it seem actually very warm and homely.

The council hall~
You stand inside perhaps the most impressive of the castle's wooden
structures, a longhouse engineered and buttressed from inside to
withstand siege.  Its walls are braced and bound with thick iron
strips, and no windows allow a view either in or out.  Aside from
its fairly defensive posture, the hall itself looks quite comfortable.
A large rug dominates the floor of the hall, stretching from this end
to the west, where a large fireplace burns cheerily.  In the center, a
long, darkly stained wooden table is surrounded by twelve chairs.

The council hall~
You stand in the western end of the council hall.  The defensive posturing
of the engineers who built this hall is such that it might withstand as
much attack as the castle's walls of stone.  Whoever ordered such
construction obviously takes no chances, or is somewhat paranoid.
However, the chamber itself is comfortable.  Around the darkly stained
wooden table, twelve cushioned chairs sit, and a large fireplace warms
the building.  No windows allow sunshine or prying eyes within or
without, however.

allow.  After recent assassination attempts, however, the Lord generally
keeps to himself, hence the infrequent usage of the hall.
