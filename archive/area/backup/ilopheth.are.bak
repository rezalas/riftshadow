a statue of an ancient druid~
A statue of a bearded man is carved from white stone.
~
Standing behind the altar with arms uplifted, this statue is done
in exquisite detail.  Rendered in a smooth white stone, the man's
solemn expression is beautifully cast, as he apparently conducts
some sort of druidic rite.  The clothing he wears is remarkable,
seeming to be made of real cloth.  A long beard is visible above his
flowing robes, adding to the impression that this man is both
ancient, and wise.

A Thin Trail Between the Trees~
The forest floor is well-worn here, as a thin trail weaves its way among
the trees.  The height of the surrounding trees is astounding, and with
their foliage blotting out the light far above this trail has the
feeling of a large cavern.  Chittering and rustling can be heard all
around, however, as the residents of this forest forage among the leaves
that cover the ground.  To the east, the trail continues between some
slightly smaller trees.  To the west, the trail opens into a grove of
the incredibly large trees.

This does not seem to be so much a grove of trees as a grove of enormous
wooden shafts, jutting impossibly into the sky.  The actual foliage lies

This trail is narrow and steep, and its navigation is made difficult by
the many small rocks that interfere with the footing.  The trees here are
a bit smaller, perhaps stunted a bit by the severity of the slope.
Rustling sounds can be heard through the underbrush, with bushes growing
in thick clusters along the edges of the trail.  The slope levels off

A Muddy Forest Intersection~
This large, muddy section of the forest seems more like a small crater than
a typical forest intersection.  Large puddles of dark water are strewn
haphazardly among the muck.  Thick lichen covers the black rocks that emerge
from the saturated forest floor.  Even the trees seem to rot away at the trunk,
with craggy limbs twisted in helpless protest.  The muddy intersection continues
to the west and south, while a small, damp trail leads through some
underbrush to the north.

A wide river flows rapidly south, bordered by steep banks on the eastern

The Luminous Cascade~
The river here seems to enter a nook in the mountain range, as steep, jagged
rocks wall you in on three sides, to the north, east, and west.  Large trees,
extending from the bluffs high above, come together across the narrow canyon
to form a thick canopy, sending shadows sprawling across both the river and
its rocky walls.  The walls themselves channel running water through well-worn
hollows, and the roar is deafening as water cascades from the mountains above
to fall all around.  The falling water seems to be imbued with a pale yellow
glow which dissipates as it settles into the river below.  The flickering
glow along with the shade of the trees high above lends an eerie yellowish
cast to everything around.  The river itself continues to the south.

A Grassy Clearing~
You stand on a neat lawn of immaculately kept grasses.  Fairly large and
square, it is bordered  to the south by a row of impossibly tall hedges
which seem to mask a steep embankment.  There is a small opening in the
hedges to the east, where another smaller grassy patch can be seen.  To
the west the grasses continue onto a small, round hill, while to the north
a small beach of pale rocks leads back toward the pond.

A Circle of Stones~
Set a bit apart from the grassy clearing is another flat stretch of grasses
surrounded on three sides by a semicircle of impossibly tall hedges.  At the
center of this strange arena is an equally mysterious ring of sun-bleached
stones.  These man-sized rocks are partially embedded in the ground, and
point into the air haphazardly, without any apparent purpose or pattern.  In
the center of the circle, the grass has been worn away, leaving a smooth
dirt surface in which many odd tracks can be seen.  You can return to the
larger clearing to the west.

A Narrow Trail, Deep in the Forest~
This narrow, dirt trail is bordered on the east and west by dark, gnarled
trees and tangled underbrush that makes passage impossible.  The canopy
overhead is thick, almost giving the impression that this is a cavern rather
than a forest.  The wilderness is still and quiet here, and only the occasional
buzzing of insects can be heard.  The narrow trail runs directly to the north,

Some Marshland, Near a Murky Stream~
The ground here consists of dark, sticky soil that sits lumped in uneven
piles where either time or some strange creature has left it.  There is
a strong odor of decomposition all around, likely plant and animal both.
Small pools of water sit here and there, and biting insects seem to hover
around them in clusters.  In places, enormous reeds can be seen sprouting
up in thick clusters.  A dark, slow-moving stream glides by to the north,
while the marshes continue to the east, west, and south.

Small pools of water sit here and there, and biting insects seem to hover

an odd thatched hut sits on a slightly raised platform to the north.

Within the Hut of the Marsh-Hag~
The bamboo walls of this hut are almost invisible, completely obscured
by strange shamanistic carvings and totems that hang everywhere.  A
pile of straw in one corner seems to serve as a bed, and the only other
furnishing of note is a crude iron cauldron sitting, cold, in the center
of the room.  The thatched roof seems to be strong enough to keep out
any inclement weather, but its intricate weave and flawless attachments
might indicate that the owner of this hut had some magical assistance in
its contruction.  You can return to the marshes to the south.

Below the Surface of the Pond~
Large green masses of algae sit caked into bundles, hanging still in the
stagnant water.  Although it is repulsive, this pond seems to contain a
thriving ecosystem.  Large fish, small fish, and various other forms of
marine life swim all about.  The bottom of the pond is dark and ominous,
likely consisting of some sort of clay.  You can continue beneath the
water to the north and west, or simply return to the water's surface.

Tangled Undergrowth, Before a Shack~
Thick brambles grow in clumps on the forest floor here, only receding in
places to allow passage.  The sharp thorns rend flesh and cloth alike, and
the vines seem to have an affinity for coiling around limbs.  Although the
undergrowth chokes off any new growth, the trees that rise up here appear
ancient, with thick, gnarled trunks.  Even their canopy is oppressive,
branches hanging a short distance overhead, blotting out the sky.  To the
west, some rotting boards seem thrown together to form some sort of
dwelling.  To the east, a worn trail seems much more hospitable.

Within a Rotting Shack~
It is amazing that this foul dwelling is standing.  Fungus grows in
clumps on the rotting walls, the decomposition contributing to a rank odor
that hangs thick in the air.  The dirt floor is worn in the center, but
weeds and brambles grow in clumps in the shadowy corners.  Overhead, tree
branches are almost indistinguishable from the haphazard ceiling - it very
much appears that the forest creates a special canopy covering this shelter.
Books and papers are strewn about within, in various conditions and stages
of decomposition.  A small oil lamp provides the only meager light,
illuminating the western wall with a pale glow.  A rotting board which
appears to function as a door stands to the east.
