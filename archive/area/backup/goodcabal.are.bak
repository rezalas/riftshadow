a cloaked guardian~
A figure cloaked in white huddles here in the cold.
~
A large figure wrapped in several thick white woolden robes is before
you.  A massive pelt of the white wolf is draped across his back, and
clasped together with a beautiful golden brooch.  A wooly hood and and white
scarf reveal only this mans eyes, which sparkle like sapphires.  You notice
a massive sword slung across this figure back, and the sheath seems to be
steaming, strangely enough.

A stern-looking man in ornate robes vehemently chants and lectures.

The man before you is garbed in a robe the color of alabaster, interwoven
with strands of silver and gold.  His visage is soft and kind, yet an air of
determination emanates from him.  Long strands of silver hair cascade down
from his head and drape upon his shoulders.  A shimmering belt of
interlinking rings holds his tunic tightly against his waist.

Before a Frost-Covered Temple~
Frost and snow mottles the ground, the scent of cold, damp earth fills
the air.  An archway has been carved into the dark stone of the mountain to
the south, leading into a torch-lit passageway.  To the north, the forested
trail continues to the east and west.

A Simple Foyer~
Cold, earthy air swirls into this room, keeping the air fresh but rich. 
Smooth beige tiles are set into the floor, contrasting with the rough, dark
rock that makes up the rounded walls.  Flickering torches circle the foyer,
which still seems dark despite the light they provide.  Passageways lead off
to the east and west, and a staircase carved into the southern wall leads up
into another room above.

The Hall of Inquisition~
A semicircle of high chairs have been arranged around a single podium. 
Steel chains and manacles lie on the ground near the podium, which is
presumably where those accused of evil stand to face the Inquisitors and
meet their fate.  Paintings of the gods of Light, both contemporary and
ancient, are placed here and there on the walls.  A marble tile mosaic
depicting a orange and white flame is set into the northern wall.

A Fiery Altar~
Holy symbols and wards decorate this otherwise spartan chamber.  Gashes
and stains cover the floors and walls, and the scent of blood, sweat and
metal permeates the air.  In the center of the room, a plain altar flickers
with faint flames, completely uncharred and unaffected by them.  To the
south, an archway leads to a broad staircase.
