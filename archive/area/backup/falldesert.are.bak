A low, unearthly moan erupts through the air as a ghost like figure
materializes in front of you.  The figure, at first glance, seems to
resemble a wraith like figure, yet upon closer inspection, many heads are
noticable.  The face seems to change constantly.  A sword is in the hands of
this figure, a sword that seems to have a slightly blue tint to it, as well
as a shining ring is on the middle right hand finger of the spirit.

A Forest Road~
A small road cuts through the trees heading off in an easterly direction
and not seeming to deviate much from that course.  The road itself seems to
have been made of dark grey stones placed carefully side by side.  The
forest surrounding the road is alive with the noises of nature and wildlife.
The stone road continues to the east and originates to the west.

The grey road that seems to have been so well maintained in the steps to

canyon can be seen.  A small trail leads south into the canyon whlie the

rocks falling from the high canyon walls.  This cave seems to have sat for
years in the same state.  There is no sand or extra rock and the floor of
the cave is surprisingly smooth.  The path out of the cave is to the east.

the east while the path to the desert is to the south.

The only shelter from the desert sands seems to be a small crevice
protected from the heat and winds by a sheer rock face.  The sands are so
cool here that a small spring has been found and cultivated, as well as a
shade of trees that form a small oasis.  The beauty of the oasis compared to
the bleakness of the desert is a refreshing change.  The way out of the
oasis, if any should choose to leave for the travel through the desert, is
back to the south.

Sand seems to cover a path that is made only by the rock walls

A strong wind runs between the rock walls stinging the unprotected eyes of
anything that enters.  The sun can barely be seen because of the walls.  The

Overlooking a Crater~
After walking out of the brightness of the sands, the sight beyond the
trail is unbelievable.  The trail seems to end in a large hole.  Peering
over the edge into the hole, all that can be seen is darkness.  Upon further
examination, the trail seems to wind itself around the hole.  The crater, as
it looks to be, seems to made by a huge impact upon the earth.  Small hills
of pure rock are seen around the crater as if the impact made the earth
itself buckle.  The trail to the sands leads back to the north while the
trail around the crater wanders to both the east and west.

Overlooking a Crater~
After walking out of the brightness of the sands, the sight beyond the
trail is unbelievable.  The trail seems to end in a large hole.  Peering
over the edge into the hole, all that can be seen is darkness.  Upon further
examination, the trail seems to wind itself around the hole.  The crater, as
it looks to be, seems to made by a huge impact upon the earth.  Small hills
of pure rock are seen around the crater as if the impact made the earth
itself buckle.  The trail around the crater continues towards both the east

A Stone Path through the Sands~
A trail winds the way through the sands towards the south.  The path is
made of stone, polished and hard and seemingly very well taken care of.  The
canyon walls seem to rise and fall in height as the trail winds through
them.  Further along the trail you can see lights that almost seem like
torch flames.  The trail winds towards the south while the way back to the

A Rocky Trail~

until one hidden by the sand touches a boot or foot.  Sand still reflects
the sunlight and heat back upon the unwary and unprotected travellers, yet
it seems to have lessened the further south you travel.  The canyon walls
still can be seen on both sides of the trail and seem to be getting larger
as the trails gets longer.  The trail winds to the east while the way back

A Dead End~
The sun beats down into this roofless cave heating the sands to
unbearable temperatures.  The hole that travellers enter through is now
completely hidden.  The rock walls, seemingly polished to perfection like
solid diamond, reflects the sunlight and the heat back into the depths of
the cave.  There is no shelter from the burning light wind, the hot
sunlight, or the heat of the sands underneath.  There is no exit from this
cave, and it seems to be hopeless to return to the world.

A Path Through the Village~
A trail leads through a small village.  The village is surrounded by rock
walls.  The people here seem to be almost nomadic, living in tents and
keeping what furs they can.  They seem to ready to move on a whim, almost to
the point of having everything but the tents packed.  Furs of mountain lions
and leggings and tunics covered with mountain goat wool can be seen all
around, as well as upon the tents.  Small poles and ladders lead into tents
around the village, protection from the winds found in small caves upon the
rock face.  The path through the village pushes on to the south while the
way back to the stone path can be seen to the north.  A tent can be seen to

A Path Through the Village~
A trail leads through a small village.  The village is surrounded by rock
walls.  The people here seem to be almost nomadic, living in tents and
keeping what furs they can.  They seem to ready to move on a whim, almost to
the point of having everything but the tents packed.  Furs of mountain lions
and leggings and tunics covered with mountain goat wool can be seen all
around, as well as upon the tents.  Small poles and ladders lead into tents
around the village, protection from the winds found in small caves upon the
rock face.  The path through the village pushes on to the west and south and
a ladder leads up into another tent.

A Village Tent~
While outside the tents, the village seems nomadic and movable, the
inside of the tents are homely and comfortable.  Small pieces of furniture
and even beds are made from a strange wood.  Spears and daggers are resting
on stands, polished and sharpened, waiting to be used.  The pole in the
middle of the tent can be used to get back to the village path.

The Elder's Tent~
If the tents of the village looked comfortable, the tent of the Elder of
the Village is a palace.  The east part of the elder's tent is furnished
with chairs, chests, a bed, a table, and even a small desk.  The inside of
the tent is made of shimmering white silk and the floor is covered in a soft
blanket of cloth.  A flap covers the entrance into the west side of the tent
as well as the exit back to the village path to the north.

The Fallen Desert~
The rock face surrounds the desert to the east.  The wind and sunlight
bounces off the walls back into the desert, making the area nearest the
walls some of the hottest area.  The only way to return to the desert and
find chances of survival is back to the west, to the north, and to the south

The sands stretch in every direction.  On the horizon can barely be seen
stone walls.  The heat is almost unbearable and it's obvious no plant and
most likely no animal could survive.  The nearest rock face seems to be to
the south while sands stretch everywhere else.
