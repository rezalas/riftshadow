The Temple of Ilya Eru~
Carved of the purest white marble, the walls and ceiling stand nearly
thirty feet above the gleaming white floor.  Each wall holds a width of at
least fifteen feet.  Statues grace the walls, each holding the resemblance
of one of the Caelumaedani Lords.  A shallow carved pit of sacrifices adorns
the center of the room with a noticeable glint of gold shining from within. 
A fountian, also carved of the lusterous white marble, stands in front of an
open archway on the eastern wall.  The fountain has been carved into a
perfect rectangle standing ten feet tall.  At the bottom of this huge slab
of marble is a shallow hollowed out square of marble, catching the water
falling from above.

The Sanctuary~
This room is also carved out of the beautiful white marble.  On either
side of the entrance are rows of marvelously carved pews that look as if
they and the floor are one entity.  Further up the aisle created by the pews
are three wide steps that lead up to a pulpit, also carved of marble. 
Behind the pulpit is a massive stain-glass window, covering nearly the whole
wall.  How it is ancored into the marble cannot be seen, but it does not
look as if it could be moved with any kind of brute force.  When the sun
rises and the light hits the window, the room is filled with unimaginably
beautiful colors of the rainbow.  To the north an open archway graces the
wall, leading to a small chamber, the south wall also has an open archway
leading to a small chamber.  A set of free standing spiral stairs is in the
northwest corner of the room, leading up to a small landing with another
open archway with a room behind it as well.

Depictions of Holy Crusades are woven into tapestries that hang on the
walls.  Suits of full platemail stand in the corners, looking as if they
might come alive should any intruders come along.  A large entryway is on
the northern wall, a rather large suit of armor guarding the entrance to the
Paladin guild hall to the right of it.

historical scenes involving famous zealots are embroidered on it.  A large
curio cabinet is on the eastern wall.  Various robes, paintings, books and
jewelry are placed on display for visitors to see.

This small landing looks out over the entire sanctuary.  This is the best

landing are as sturdy as if you were standing on the ground floor.  They
look as if someone cleans and polishes them every day.

Racks of weapons and suits of armor take up almost all the space on the
walls.  Larger weapons are mounted horizontally above the racks and suits in
columns.  The suits are all different sizes, shapes, and colors.  Each suit
has a plaque mounted on the bottom of its stand saying who the owner was. 
In the center of the room is a practice dummy and a tall weathered man
standing next to it instructing students.

Entrance to the Healer Guild~
Two lanterns hang on either side of the door leading to the High-Priest's
chambers.  This dimly lit room has little in it to make it look homely or
welcoming.  It does have an old worn wooden chair sitting in the corner. 
Though the rooms is made of the white marble like the rest of the building,
it seems dingy, as though someone forgot to clean this room along with the
rest.

looking drow woman stands near the oak table teaching zealots how to
properly use their supplications.

A plethora of holy relics grace the walls of this room.  Memorabilia from

practically are bursting from the wardrobe on the northern wall.  A small
desk pilled with papers sits on the eastern wall, with a plush apolstried
wooden chair hastily push back.  A small unadorned cot sits on the west
wall, with only a pillow and ragged blanket to cover it.  The floor has many
different carpets from all over Shalar, making it look like a quilt.

Outside the Temple~
A magnificent white marble temple makes all other beautiful things in the
city pale in comparison.  This temple makes even the largest giant seem
small.  Well cared for gardens lie on either side of the temple steps,
filled with all the colors of the rainbow and then some.  Great pillars draw
attention to the wide entry way.  A glint of gold and the shimmer of water
can be seen from the street.

The South Gate~
A high stone wall blocks all view of the land outside the city.  Two
large stone doors hooked up a pully system for a gate to protect the city
from both the sand and any intruders.  A bleary eyed guard is always at his
post next to the gate to watch travelers for any suspiciousness and to open
and close the gates at sunrise and sunset.

North Gate~
A high stone wall blocks all view of the land outside the city.  Two
large stone doors hooked up a pully system for a gate to protect the city
from both the sand and any intruders.  A bleary eyed guard is always at his
post next to the gate to watch travelers for any suspiciousness and to open
and close the gates at sunrise and sunset.
