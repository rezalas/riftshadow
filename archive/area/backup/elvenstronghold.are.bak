Before a vast ravine~
Before you lies a deep ravine spanned by a wooden bridge ahead.  The

An Archer's Post~
This small area is where the archers take their post.  A small window of
sorts has been dug through the soil and much of the forest before the
stronghold can be seen.  Sunlight pours in through the window and the smells
of the forest waft in though the opening.

Entrance to the Ancient Halls of Gwenidill~
A strange glow seems to eminate from the walls here, giving light to the
halls.  The air is heavy with age, and the absolute silence of these halls
is devastating.  An inch of dust covers the floor, and the eyes of a

seems to eminate from the walls themselves, giving light to the halls.  The

E note~
My first discovery in the night sky, and named accordingly after myself.
 
-Signed
(The name here appears to have been worn off.)
~
E map~
An old tattered star chart is hung upon the wall here detailing the
formations of the most important constellations captioned with their form
and cycle.  
 
A mass of ten white stars forming a charging bull.
-Found in the southwest quadrant of the winter sky.
 
Eight young yellow stars forming a five pointed crown.
-Found in the Northwest quadrant of the Autumn sky.
A cluster of white stars in the shape of a fist.
-Seen in the center of the sky during the long days of warmth.
 
A tight formation of stars forming a great horn.
-Found in the southeastern quadrant of the season of rebirth.
A massive formation of red stars forming a stallion.
-Found in the southern quadrant of the sky during the season of plenty.
 
The five brightest stars in the night sky.
-Located directly above Gwenidill during all seasons.
 
Towards the bottom of the chart you notice an entry made hastily in black script detailing a crescent shaped constellation.
 
An almost illegible note is written beneath the last entry.
