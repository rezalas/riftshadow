A Snowy Path~
The hard frozen ground is lightly covered with a thin layer of fluffy
snow.  Peppered throughout, small wisps of vegetation poke up from the snow.
Frost boils appear on the ground like a giant's footprints.  Tussocks of
frost-heaved soil resemble plowed fields at a distance but look more like
mops upon closer inspection.  Large thick sheets of ice flow along the
eastern and western sides creating the feeling of being funneled towards
something.

An Icy Cave~
A large naturally formed crevice made from thick flows of ice.  The walls
and floor are made from thick ropey flows of ice.  The flow of the ice
follows the sloped surface of the floor to the west.  Large thick icicles
hang down from the ceiling, some reaching the floor to make thick pillars. 
The ice is pristine allowing you to see completely through the pillars with
little blurring.

Entrance to a Large Cave~
All is quiet save the repetitive drops water falling from the moist
ceiling of the cave.  The rock here is pitted as if corroded unnaturally. 
The rock itself is non-descript dull grey, and spotted throughout with black
flecks and little crystals that twinkle in the almost nonexisitent light. 
Ominous sounds echo off the cold dead stone, reverberating through the damp
air of the cave.  The dim light of the outside world can be seen off to the

A Barren Plateau~
A vast plateau spreads out before you here, nearly completely void of
life, save various tufts of dry grass.  The ground is uneven and difficult
to traverse, as the naturally formed rock fights with itself.  Slabs of
solid grey rock push from the north against the deep red stone from the
south.  A small rift runs east west where the two materials join, buckling
the grey rock into itself.  The ground reverberates occasionally with a
hidden strength as the battle between the two materials slowly progresses.

A Snowy Path~
Hard frozen ground is lightly covered with a thin layer of fluffy snow. 
Peppered throughout, small wisps of vegetation poke up from the snow.  Frost
boils appear on the ground like a giant's footprints.  Tussocks of
frost-heaved soil resemble plowed fields at a distance but look more like
mops upon closer inspection.  A rough surface of thick ice slowly flows from
the north attempting to swallow the path.
