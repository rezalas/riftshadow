The Western Arch~
A large, gleaming glass arch rises above you, completely devoid of any
sort of designs or markings.  Through the arch, you can see the lobby of the
Glass Tower, a mecca of magic that is as famous as it is ancient.  There are
few inhabitants of Melcene anywhere nearby, save a commoner or two who has
come to gawk at the Tower's splendor.  A way off to the west, you can see
the buzzing streets of Melcene, seeming almost muted from here.  A tiny
inscription has been written on a stone in the ground.

Everything around you is made of glass, but none of it bears so much as a
tiny scratch. Though much of it is clear, some are made opaque by the colors
that they are stained, ranging from red to copper to blue to a milky white.
The shuffling feet of scholars echo off of the crystalline walls, which give
the resounding sounds a strange, otherworldly quality.

Everything around you is made of glass, but none of it bears so much as a
tiny scratch. Though much of it is clear, some are made opaque by the colors
that they are stained, ranging from red to copper to blue to a milky white.
The shuffling feet of scholars echo off of the crystalline walls, which give

a door leads into a shop of some sort, while to the south, you can see the
bottom of the eastern staircase.

Everything around you is made of glass, but none of it bears so much as a
tiny scratch. Though much of it is clear, some are made opaque by the colors
that they are stained, ranging from red to copper to blue to a milky white.
Jutting up from the opaque glass floor in such a way that it is apparent that
the glass was never cut, and was simply molded, is a spiral staircase
that leads up into a higher level of the tower. The lobby continues in all
directions around you.

The Eastern Arch~
A large, gleaming glass arch rises above you, completely devoid of any
sort of designs or markings.  Through the arch, you can see the lobby of the
Glass Tower, a mecca of magic that is as famous as it is ancient.  There are
few inhabitants of Melcene anywhere nearby, save a commoner or two who has
come to gawk at the Tower's splendor.  A way off to the west, you can see
the buzzing streets of Melcene, seeming almost muted from here.

The Scribe's Shop~
Different kinds of magical inks, papers and quills line shelves all around
the room. A glass case set into the counter displays a number of scrolls, each
carefully placed on red velvet stands, leaning back, so that the scrolls face
the customers. Each scroll has a silver plaque underneath it inscribed with
the magics that it contains. To the south, a door leads back out into the
lobby.

The Alchemist's Shop~
The pungent odors of herbs, chemicals and metals being brewed combine to make
an overpowering stench that easily drives out those that do not have a
need to be here. A hunch-backed old man wearing a turban of dark magenta
shambles around behind the counter at an alarming speed, grabbing reagents
and various mixing, measuring and pulverizing instruments and putting them
to use. A doorway lies to the north, leading back out into the lobby.

Hundreds of tiny charms hang from the ceiling, each seemingly very fragile
and delicate and of various colors and materials. A light incense burns
behind the counter, where the enchantress stands. Curtains cover up the
storage area behind her, in which boxes are barely visible in the
darkness. A doorway leads to the north into the lobby.

This room is massive. Ornate carpets are placed neatly in certain spots about
the floor, covering the silver and glass tiles. An unidentifiable source of
light shines down upon the room from the ceiling, reflecting and refracting
from multiple places about the room. Large bookshelves have been set into the
walls, housing some important works.

The glass surrounding you seems to be slightly different than the glass in

opaque material sporadically rise up from the ground near the walls and meld
into the ceiling, seeming to be more for decoration than support. A single

A Small Room~
Thick pillars of glass line both sides of the room, each casting a
shimmering glow that is reflected and refracted by the unnaturally flawless
crystal that makes up the Tower. Quiet whispers can be heard from time to
time; ethereal echoes chilled by the walls of glass. Small shelves line the
walls, and an ebon cabinet stands up against the southern wall, along with
a desk and a cot that lies perpendicular to the cabinet against the eastern
wall.

The Fourth Floor of the Glass Tower~
The glass on this floor is completely opaque, and ranges in color from
obsidian to cyan and copper, much of it looking as if it were stained by some
exotic oil. A strange chemical scent fills the air, and the scholars that
happen to be passing through these halls seem to be in a state of perpetual
panic and anxiety. There is little, if any audible whispering here, but
strange chanting by unseen denizens of the tower echo throughout this floor. A
single line of crimson marble bisects the hallway, which continues to the
east.

The Fifth Floor of the Glass Tower~
The most striking feature of this particular floor is not the beautiful
prismatic glass that makes it up, nor is it the strange windchime-like sound
that mingles with the faint chanting from the floor below, but the complete
and utter absence of scholars or scholar's quarters. The entire hallway
brightens and dims slowly, as if it should somehow be connected with the
beating heart of the Tower, if the Tower were to have such a thing. This
brightening and dimming would be more likened to the sun passing behind
a field of sporadically placed clouds than an intense exhibition of magical
power, though it is rather obvious that it is the latter.

reaches its pinnacle here, the glass tube which contains it rising exactly
