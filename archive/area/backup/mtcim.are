a common traveler~
A human man in worn traveling clothes seems lost in the bustle.
~
The look of frustration that is so common along this oft cramped and
rough trail has found a home on this traveler's face. His clothes are
smudged with dirt, and on his back is a simple knapsack that seems very
light and empty. As he pushes his way through the crowd, he keeps one
hand out in front of him and the other on the dagger in his belt.

A fat man in colorful, though tacky, clothes pushes through the crowd.
~
A tangle of greasy brown hair crowns this large merchant. His clothing
is far too elaborate for the obviously low quality materials used to
make them, and are dyed with the brightest hues of the basic colors.
Sweat covers his face as he grumbles, puffs and uses his size to try
to wade through the sea of people around him.

The glimmer in this adolescent's eyes and the feral dirt that is
smudged all over his clothing and body instantly reveals him for
what he is. But, as his slender figure weaves its way through the
crowd effortlessly, there are few that seem to notice him at all,
much less notice him lifting a few coins from their heavy purses.

The Start of a Rough Trail~
At the top of this ridge begins a beaten path through the well-known
Mount Cim, a double-peaked mountain that serves as a foundation for
the largest city in all of Shalar. To the east, a crowd of people
hustles and bustles to enter the pass to the north, while below
are the outskirts of Cimar.

From here you can see the towering body of Mount Cim: a large
mountain with two peaks, both capped in snow. The jagged rocks range
in color from brown to gray, the pinnacles cloaked in white. Thin
trails and patches of forest seem to be scattered around the bottom
half of the mountain. Between the double peaks lies a sort of valley,
where the forest seems to be the thickest.

A Narrow Pass~
Two enormous structures of rock stand on either side of the trail,
narrowing it to hardly eight feet in width... Just enough for most
merchant caravans to be able to squeeze through. It would seem that
the two separate formations were once one, but they were somehow
artificially separated to make this trail possible. Two small wooden
ledges have been built into the walls about twenty feet up, where
archers have been stationed. The ground is obviously well travelled,
and its lack of rocks and brush is not surprising. All that covers
the light rock is a thin layer of powdery gray dirt.

A T-Crossing in The Mountain Pass~
Here, most of the traffic turns to the east. A few of the more rugged
adventurers slink off to the west, where the trail becomes quite a bit
rougher. Another elevated guard post is set into the northern rock wall
to watch for pickpockets, goblins or any other possible manifestation
of trouble.

The trail widens here, and the dusty gray earth seems to be becoming
lighter in hue. The crowd speaks freely here, showing that the danger
in this place is lesser than it is in other parts of the mountain.

the trail continues, and becomes even lighter in color.

The bustling crowd here is continually kicking up the chalky white dust

Evergreen trees sporadically cover the slopes along the sides of the
path, and a few pine cones can be found on the floor here and there.
Fauna, however, does not show its face here. The sea of people has
begun to move a bit more quickly here due to the eagerness to reach
the end of this mountainous region, which is not far off.

The crowd here is relatively quiet, perhaps out of fear of a raid, or
perhaps out of a sort of claustrophobia. The trail has become narrow due
to the suddenly increased steepness of the slopes surrounding it to the

pebbles tumble from the surrounding slopes. To the east, the trail

narrow at points. Although it is far from a forest, there are a few trees
scattered about this area. From time to time, a small wilderness creature
can be spotted around here. The trail winds to the west and to the north.

A Trail's End~
The trail ends here, and the wilderness begins. Although it is far from a
forest, there are a few trees scattered about this area. From time to time,
a small wilderness creature can be spotted around here. Rocks and steep
slopes make this a tiresome trek, but it is possible for the well-traveled
or stubborn to handle. To the east, you can return to the trail, while to
the north or to the west, the mountain awaits.

On the Western Side of Mount Cim~
This part of the mountain is rather steep, and it is possible to ascend
the mountain if navigated correctly. There are a few trees scattered about
this area. From time to time, a small wilderness creature can be spotted
around here. Large rocks and other such obstacles make this a tiresome trek,
but it is possible for the well-traveled or stubborn to handle. To the south
lies the end, or beginning, of a trail, while to the west, the side of the

A Forested Plateau~
The ground is relatively even, with the exception of the odd up or down
slope or outstanding tree root. The trees here are exceptionally tall,
and the forest is rather dense, making passage difficult. The air is
rather thin and cold, and occasionally, a patch of snow can be found on
the ground. To the north, the forest thins out and the terrain becomes

The forest thins here as it runs up against a sheer wall of granite. A few
stones stick out from the wall to the north, but they are perfectly shaped
and obviously artificial. It is apparent that the wilderness here is not as
pure and untouched as most would think. To the south, the forest continues,
while climbing the rock to the north would bring you closer to the peak.

The Western Peak of Mount Cim~
Finally, you stand upon the icy apex of the western peak of Mount Cim.
Looking toward the northeast, the eastern peak is visible, and of
approximately the same height. All around you the air is very free,
but the ground is very steep, especially to the east. Below, Cimar
looks small, yet intricate and the bustling people in the pass near
the mountain's base aren't even visible. Much of the rest of the lands
further away seem very hazy due both to the facts that you are above
many of the clouds, and that you are simply very far away from them.

A Dark and Narrow Passage~
This cramped and narrow passage is composed entirely of a sort of
slick, jagged black rock, which is uncharacteristic of Mount Cim,
a mountain almost completely made of gray stone. To climb back up
to the peak from here is impossible, due to the sheerness and glass-
like smoothness of the rock. From here, you can only head to the south.

This crevice opens up into a secluded place somewhere between the two peaks
of the mountain. In the distance, you can hear and smell running water, and
a fine mist constantly drifts in from the south. The rocks around you are
covered with moss from the constant exposure to dampness.

shape of the rocks behind it. There is something strange about the pool,
though... It has no obvious outlet, yet it never gets any more full than
it is.

E pool~
Upon closer examination, you notice that the pool has a perfectly circular
hole toward the back of it, toward which the entire pool is slanted so
that the water drains into the depths of the mountain. An even stranger
problem: Where is the water coming from?

A Damp Cavern~
Darkness envelopes this cavern almost as strongly as the scent of damp
earth does. The sound of the waterfall echoes loudly throughout the cave,
which continues to the south and east, while the waterfall lies back to
the west.

A Beautifully Carved Alcove~
Thin beams of light enter this room from numerous holes in the ceiling,
revealing a shrine-like room. The walls are covered with multi-colored
shells from the southern seas, causing the reflecting light to take on
a prismatic effect. Numerous statues of odd-looking humanoids are carved
from the rock itself, so that the statues are literally part of the
mountain. It is quite obvious that this place has remained relatively
untouched for ages upon ages.

A High Ledge on the Eastern Mountain~
The chilling wind whips around you as the air becomes thinner by the

and both the flora and the fauna have begun to disappear. To the west,
the ledge continues, and on the northern wall are some smooth stones that
make climbing down possible.

Below the Eastern Peak~
The chilling wind whips around you as the air becomes thinner by the
moment. Much of the ground is covered by a layer of ice, and the plant-
life is completely nonexistant at thie height. To the west, a ledge
gradually slopes down and around toward the plateau below you. On the
southern wall, some indentations have been carved into the rock, allowing
an easy climb to the eastern peak.

The Eastern Peak of Mount Cim~
A broad ledge serves as footing here, for the peak itself is almost
unclimbable. The remainder of the peak rises about fifteen feet above
the ledge, but it is sheer and icy. Below you, you can see the entirety
of Mount Cim, along with the frosty clouds that swirl around both
peaks. Over to the west, you can see the other peak of the mountain,
standing at about the same height. A weathered trail branches off of
the ledge and leads around the peak to the south, while you can climb
down to a narrower ledge via some handholds below you.

An Ancient Trail Around the Eastern Peak~
This path is composed of intricately carved cobblestones that have been
weathered by the harsh climate up here. A thin layer of ice covers the
trail, making the carvings' features indistinguishable. A frigid wind
whips around you, bringing with it a puff of snow. To the north lies a
broad ledge, while to the east, the ancient trail continues.

The End of an Ancient Trail~
This is as far as it is physically possible to climb. The chilling
winds whip around the peak, and the trail stops abruptly, ending in
a sheer vertical cliff facing toward the east. Brilliantly white ice
covers the ground beneath you, and the footing is far from steady. To
the north, the mountain continues to climb for another twenty feet or
so. Just off the weathered trail, a small crevice is set into the ground.

A Small, Frigid Cave~
In this tiny, cramped cave, every wall is composed of frost-covered
jagged black stones.  In the eastern wall, there is a deep, mossy niche.
Cold wind drifts in from above, where the eastern peak stands proudly.  The
ground is solid, yet as you step, something crunches beneath your feet.  You
can climb back out of this cramped cavern using the rocks to the north.
