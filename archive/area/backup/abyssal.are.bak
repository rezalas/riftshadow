is still dim and perpetual darkness seems to try to creep in and gain a

of gold and red.  The thrones themselves are wooden and engraved with ivory
and gold.  Swords and axes hang above the throne, polished yet still
completely deadly.  A large door is guarded to the north by a deadly looking
guard.  A strong scent of food comes from what seems to be the west door
while the waiting room is back to the south.

Sacred Temple of Zealots~
A large priest stands here, presiding over the other priests of the
guild.  Along the walls of the temple are sacred symbols of the abyssal
priesthood.  The zealots here also have a small practice area for weapons
and ability training time.  The guild can be exited to the west.

A Commoners Room~
This room has very little decoration.  It is obvious that a commoner of
the fortress lives here.  A small bed is in the corner as well as a
washstand on the other corner.  The walls are made of stone, grey and bleak
as most of the rest of the fortress.  The way back to the hallway is to the

A Stone Hallway~
The rock walls of this hallway are grey and bleak.  Torches line the path
at a step of a titan each.  Even with the flames casting light, the hallway
is still dim and perpetual darkness seems to try to creep in and gain a
foothold.  The stones radiate a coolness that even the heat of the flames
cannot affect.  The hallway continues back further into the fortress to the
south and north while a commoners room is to the east.

The armory is full of stored weapons that have just come from the forge. 
Most are cooled off yet the steam coming off some is obvious.  The handlers
of the armor wear gloves because of the nearness of the heat of the forge.
