duergar king grenlath~
King Grenlath~
A huge duergar dressed in dark armor is here, sitting on his throne.    
~
Easily the largest duergar you have ever seen, he stands near five feet in    
height and half again as wide as most duergar.  A long, angry scar runs the    
length of his face, partially obstructing vision from his left eye.  He wears    
a suit of heavy armor composed of some type of dull black material and holds    
an axe constructed of the same.  A shining mithril crown rests on his head, set    
with a single emerald.  He sits on the large throne, a cruel grin on his face    
as he watches you approach.

Ordran~
Ordran the King's advisor stands here, consulting with Grenlath.    
~
A small duergar dressed in arcane robes, Ordran is the first advisor to the    
King.  He wears a whipcord belt of brownish cloth around his waist, from which    
hangs numerous magical items and scrolls, including a long link of chain with a    
small humanoid skull hanging through the eye socket.  He leans on a dark pitted    
staff, and whispers with the King from beneath the hood of his robe.  He notices   
your approach, and begins chanting the words to a spell.

duergar chief rendladtha~
Rendladtha~
A tall duergar female stands in the darkness, whispering quietly.    
~
This female duergar has risen to the position of clan chief, an extremely    
rare position for a female in the duergar culture to hold.  She seems unusually    
graceful for her kind, standing at least a foot higher than most of her kin, her   
movements quick and cat-like.  She appears to wear little in the way of armor,    
instead dressing in light clothing so as to hinder movement less.  Judging by    
her hard gaze and cruel expression, you have little doubt her position was    
well earned.

This large, muscular duergar sits here with his mouth open, drooling slightly.    
His armor is miss-matched, and appears to have seen much use and little repair.    
He absently runs a sharpening stone over his weapons as he furrows his brow in    
concentration.  One look at his eyes and you realize his position was more than    
likely won by physical strength rather than for his cunning mental ability.  He    
lets out an annoyed grunt at your presence and jumps to his feet.

The chief of the mysterious third clan of duergar mages stands here.  He bears    
no armor at all, instead wearing long dark robes.  A sash tied around his waist    
serves as a belt, from which hangs several pouches and scrolls.  A darkened    
mithril badge depicting the symbol of the clan Drel'ark hangs around his neck.

Ertruza the Demon Lord of Fire~
A titanic demon rages here, lashing out furiously through the flames.    
~
Over thirteen feet in height, this beast is unable to stand completely upright    
in the cramped caves.  His body is covered in dark reddish scales, with a long    
black mane hanging to the ground.  Large yellow eyes glare at you from beneath    
two curling ebony horns.  You catch a glimpse of a pair of dragon-like wings    
folded on its back, unable to extend in the caves.  Much of the demon is    
entirely consumed by flames, which appear to have no affect on the creature.    
The demon throws back its head and lets forth a tremendous roar, and the spiked    
tip of a tail lashes out through the flames.

This younger duergar appears to be an apprentice to the arts of magic.  He    
wears a plain mages robe with the hood pushed down around his shoulders, and    
holds a small pen which he uses to write in an iron-bound book on the desk,    
as he translates the text from a much older book.  Several scrolls and pouches    
hang from his waist, all apparantly magical in nature. Every few moments he    
glances to the south where you can see the flickering glow of candles.

A high-priestess of the spider goddess, this dark-elf female has come to meet    
with the King to investigate the disappearance of the previous drow ambassador    
to the duergar.  Over her armor she wears a thin, barely opaque dress covered    
with embroidered spiders.  You also notice a small black morning-star hanging    
from her waist.  Her irritation is evident as she surveys the small-scale    
duergar accommodations, and she promptly turns her glare to you.

high-priestess of the spider goddess requires such help.  He wears a drow pawfi    
over a suit of fine adamantite chainmail, and a pair of matching longswords    
sheathed at his waist. He glares around the room suspiciously, clearly holding    
no trust for the evil dwarven-kin.  His weapons leap soundlessly from their

decided his position no longer warrants decent treatment.  His naked body is    
strapped to a table, and his dark complexion is turning pale from pain and loss    
of blood.  He lets out a shrill scream, his will broken as the duergar probe for   
information.  Judging by the thick walls of rock and metal, you are certain his    
screams go unheard.

to one of the forges and pulls a red-hot iron rod from the flames, and pickes up   
a pair of rusted pincers.  He pauses to lick a drop of blood off the back of his   
hand, before grinning and turning his attention to you.

make out any of the duergars features beneath the heavy mithril helm, but you

mithril axe over one shoulder as he turns his gaze away from the other guards.    
He catches sight of you, and swings his axe again.

His bald head shows several scars, gifts from long years of fighting, and one    
of his eyes is an empty socket, sewen shut with a thread.  A dark fluid drips    
from the corner where his eye should have been, and he reaches up absently and

room among the stench of filthy prisoners.  As he leans over to pick up his    
weapon you notice a large key ring attached to his belt.

A duergar citizen passes by, carefully avoiding eye contact.    
~
A duergar walks by here, covered entirely in plain dark robes.  You briefly    
catch a glimpse of two eyes from beneath the hood, seen dimly by the glow of    
infravision.  A dull mithril amulet hangs around his neck, depicting the symbol    
of one of the three duergar clans.  The dark dwarf glances at you suspiciously    
before quickly ducking beneath his hood and walking away.

a fire giant slave~
A huge fire giant huddles in the corner, banging his head against the cave wall.    
~
Standing over fourteen feet in height, you doubt this giant is able to ever    
stand straight within these caves.  He crouches here in the corner of the pens,    
eyes wide as he vainly attempts to penetrate the darkness.  Without warning he    
lunges forward and slams his forehead into the wall with a soft grunt, before    
falling back to his crouching position.

A dirty svirfnebli in a torn slaves robe walks by, ignored by the duergar.    
~
This short, ragged svirfnebli appears to have been a slave for some time as he    
wanders through town, completely ignored by his duergar captors.  Unlike the    
other slaves, his duties seem to include more than hard labor, as he wanders    
unchecked through the city.  He pulls his ragged robe around him tightly,    
glancing nervously at the dark dwarves.  He pauses to look up at you briefly    
before slipping off into the darkness.

You're not certain what this duergar did to bring himself to slavery, but he    
appears none too happy with it.  His tattered robe seems far too large for his    
gaunt frame, the hem dragging on the ground as he walks.  He levels a scowl at    
you briefly then turns back to his work.

To your surprise, a felar wanders through here, dressed in the tattered robes of   
a slave.  His ragged fur pokes out from his robe in patches, much of it having    
apparently fallen out during his time in the caves.  He reaches up with one    
broken claw and scratches at his remaining fur, blinks his cat-like eyes, and    
staggers off.

This dark-elf looks much healthier than the rest of the slaves, and lacks the    
beaten, dejected look in his eye.  You can see several new wounds healing    
poorly, and his wrists bare bruises, apparently from shackles.  He watches his    
captors warily from the corner of his eye, barely paying you a glance.

A heavily muscled, bare chested duergar stands at an anvil, swinging a huge    
hammer.    
~
While roughly the same height as most of his kin, this duergar likely outweighs    
any other by half-again their weight, solely on account of his huge arms and    
shoulders.  He grips a large adamantite hammer in one hand, and brings it down    
on a piece of glowing hot metal with a shower of sparks.  His regular hammer    
strokes do not pause as he takes notice of you.

with the duergar, and his long beard is cut ragged and short, and looks to have    
been burned in several places.  Both of his eyes are swolen shut, and you doubt    
he is able to see even when conscious.

Translation from ancient Svirfnebli by Arntsar, apprentice of Regthor.    
  Original written by Counselor Drozazat Ar'Roant, date unknown.    
    
    
  Two years ago, following the unfortunate discovery of an unknown band of    
creatures by Burrow-warden Treger's mining party, our King gave me the task    
of divining the nature of the threat, which we know now as 'duergar'.    
Through no small amount of magical intervention, along with the distasteful    
'questioning' of several captive duergar, I have compiled the following    
work.  Note however that many specifics are mere speculation on my part,    
derived from my extensive research of the creatures in an attempt to fill    
in the less clear areas of their history.    
    
  The history of the Aran duergar begins approximately four thousand years    
ago, with a single clan of dwarves exiled from their native caves.  Their    
kin, those known as dwarves today, persued them deep into the bowels of the    
earth; for what reason has been lost to the ages.  Their flight eventually    
led them to the caves of the underground, where it seems they managed to hide    
from their dwarven persuers long enough to be presumed dead or lost.    
    
The dwarves, who don't assume the common title of "duergar" for at least    
another century, were indeed lost in the unfamiliar and hostile caverns.    
After an unknown amount of time during which their numbers dwindled due to    
starvation, sickness and fighting, it seems the band accidentally stumbled    
upon their salvation, much to the misfortune of the other races of Thera.    
    
The weakened band came upon a cavern in which an underground lake had    
formed at the base of a large waterfall.  In their explorings of this area    
they discovered the lair of an extremely ancient black dragon, known as    
Trel'aran.  Recognizing dragons as ancient foes of dwarven-kind, the clan    
of duergar attempted to slay the beast who, upon awakening from his decades    
long sleep, prepared to do away with the band.  One can only speculate what    
thoughts held the ancient beast, but for whatever the reason, the dragon    
wove his magic on the dwarves instead, binding them to his will and further    
darkening their hearts.    
    
This eventually led to the forming of their city amidst the tunnels of the    
deep caverns known as Aran'gird, and an extensive mithril mining project in    
the surrounding caves.  At some point during this episode of the dark-    
dwarves history, the great dragon Trel'aran reached the end of hisancient    
life span.  Worshipped as a god by the descendants of the original band of    
dwarves, it appears the dragon gifted his followers as death came upon him.    
    
We learn at this point that Trel'aran had but one bright green eye, his    
other having been lost in his youth.  Pulling his waning magical powers    
together moments before his death, he embedded his remaining eye in a    
mithril crown, and created a dark axe and suit of armor from his ebony    
scales.  In the ages since these have been the items of the duergar Kings,    
worn as a symbol of their evil power.    
    
In their culture of betrayal and deceit these items have changed owners many    
times between the chiefs of the three duergar clans, the Freth'aran and    
Grethar'aran, and the recently formed clan of spellcasters known as the    
Drel'ark...    
    
    
Here the writing trails off, the translation apparently unfinished.

      I am beginning to loose track of the days since the filthy    
  dwarves captured Lundrig and I in the caves near the elven vale, as    
  our days are broken only by the occasional times when one of the    
  guards tosses in what I assume to be food.  At least it has kept me    
  alive.  Lundrig stopped responding to me some time ago, I fear without    
  the gifts granted to me by my god, a human would be unable to remain    
  sane in these acursed tunnels...    
    
      The days have passed into weeks it seems, the duergar seem content    
  to let us rot here in our solitude.  I fear the worst for Lundrig, as    
  I have heard nothing from him in days, unless perhaps they moved him    
  from the cell next to me while I was but unaware...    
    
      I can feel my strength and my sanity slipping as I sit in this cell    
  day after day.  I fear I will waste away soon, it has become near    
  impossible to reach any communion with my god now.  If I am to do    
  anything, it must be now.  Should I make it I will return for my    
  companion, at the least bring his remains home; no one should be laid    
  to rest eternally in this place.

A collapsed tunnel~
The persistent sound of dripping water echoes throughout the cave, and the    
air feels heavy with moisture.  Fallen rocks and dirt lie scattered about,    
providing a path for you to climb back up, if you pick your way cautiously.    
Whatever water source caused this cave-in remains hidden from view, though    
it appears to have soaked into everything in sight.  You suddenly notice what    
appears to be a body partially buried under the rocks and mud, as you draw    
near you also find a small rusted plaque near the outstretched hand.  The    
darkness of another tunnel appears through the rocks to the south.

E body duergar~
While slightly decayed from the affects of the water, and partially concealed    
by the rocks, there is still enough for you to recognize the short figure.    
This duergar appears to have died a painful death trapped beneath the cave-in,    
and it appears some creature has torn at parts of him, though before or after    
death you can not tell.

The Underdark~
What you can see of the caves looks jagged and uneven, apparently crafted by    
nature.  The air is motionless and stale, contributing to the oppressive    
feeling of tons of rock and earth surrounding you.  The smallest sounds echo    
madly through the caves, assaulting your ears from every direction at once.

The pool~
The floor of this room has filled with water, quite shallow at first, but a    
a large patch of darker water suggests it deepens further in.  Every inch of    
stone in this room is covered with a slimy green fungus which glows slightly,    
casting a greenish light throughout the room.  Several unidentifiable tracks    
through the fungus lead up to the edge of the pool, though you have seen no    
sign of life through the tunnels.  A slight ripple disturbs the otherwise    
still surface of the water.

A vast cavern~
The tunnel suddenly opens up into a much wider cavern.  The ceiling reaches    
up into the darkness, ending somewhere beyond your sight.  Large stalactites    
reach down from the shadows of the ceiling, their jagged points stabbing    
towards the top of your head.  Several smaller stalagmites reach up from the    
ground, forcing you to walk around them.  From the sound of the echos, the    
cavern continues for some distance.  The smaller tunnels continue to the    
north.

E stalactite stalactites~
These huge stone formations poke out of the darkness, reaching towards the top

base to tip.  You suddenly hope they are firmly anchored in the ceiling far    
above as you walk beneath them.    
~
E stalagmite stalagmites~
Generally smaller than their companions hanging from the ceiling, they appear    
similar in structure aside from being inverted.  Created by the dripping of    
water deposits from the tips of stalactites, some of the older ones have    
actually connected at the tips, creating thin pillars.

These huge stone formations poke out of the darkness, reaching towards the top    
of your head.  Formed over thousands of years of moisture filtering through the    
limestone above, the gigantic fixtures appear to reach up to fourty feet from    
base to tip.  You suddenly hope they are firmly anchored in the ceiling far    
above as you walk beneath them.

E stalagmite stalagmites~
Generally smaller than their companions hanging from the ceiling, they appear    
similar in structure aside from being inverted.  Created by the dripping of    
water deposits from the tips of stalactites, some of the older ones have    
actually connected at the tips, creating thin pillars.

This size of this cavern is immense, in stark contrast to the often cramped    
caves of the Underdark.  The ceiling reaches up into the darkness, ending    
somewhere beyond your sight.  Large stalactites reach down from the shadows

In a small tunnel~
This small passage appears to be natural, though the pile of stones against    
the east wall seems out of place.  You immediately notice a soft yellow glow    
from farther ahead, as your eyes struggle to adjust to the change in    
lighting.  As you draw near an outcropping of rock, you notice what appears    
to be dried blood leaving a dark stain on its surface.  The tunnel continues    
on to the west.

A faintly glowing room~
The tunnel opens up into a small cave.  The room seems to have been formed    
naturally, though upon further inspection the walls, floor and ceiling appear    
charred and blackened, as if some tremendous heat source once originated in    
here.  A large crack begins on the western wall, and spider-webs its way up,    
spreading out across the ceiling, though not large enough for you to fit    
through.  The entire room is bathed in a soft yellow light, which seems to    
originate somewhere against the northern wall.  Investigating further, you    
catch a glimpse of something shiny sticking out from under the stones.

E shiny something stones~
Brushing aside several small stones, you find a braided silver chain attached    
to an oval-shaped amulet overlaid with a golden cross which glows brightly.    
As you reach out to pick up the amulet, there is a sudden flash of light, and    
a dizzy feeling comes over you...    
    
... a gaunt, filthy figure lies in front of you, huddled against the wall of    
the cave, dressed only in a torn brown robe.  A trail of blood leads from the    
man, back into the small tunnel.  He whimpers slightly as he raises his head,    
glancing around the cavern, though he apparently takes no notice of you.  You    
spin around in surprise, as shouts sound from behind you back through the    
small tunnel.  You turn back to the man, and realize he is looking straight    
at you, or straight through you, at the passage behind.  His eyes widen at    
something, as he forces himself to his feet, and thrusts his clenched fist    
in your direction, yelling something unintelligible, as a wave of light and    
heat rolls over you...    
    
... you shake your head briefly, as you return to your senses.  A feeling of    
peace washes over you as you withdraw your hand from the amulet.

Upon a ledge~
This small outcropping of rock on the eastern wall is just wide enough for    
you to walk on.  The floor looks well-worn, and cleared of any debris.  The    
route to the ground, while precarious, can easily be navigated with some    
caution.  A small opening to the east leads further into the darkness.  Just    
before you continue on you notice a large bone, several feet in length, lying    
near the edge.

In a cave~
You stare around this small room in amazement.  It is obviously not a    
naturally occurring cave, holding an approximately square shape, every    
surface showing signs of scratches, possibly from whatever tool was used    
to dig this room out.  Even more notable, however, are the massive quantities    
of bones strewn about.  All sizes and shapes from bones taller than you to    
tiny ones that crunch under your feet as you walk.  Oddly enough, you see no    
skulls among the other assorted bones.  A scratching sound suddenly fills the    
cavern then just as suddenly goes silent.  Looking about, you can see no    
obvious source.

them lie about, stacked in piles throughout the room.  The shredded carcass    
of some recent, unidentifiable, kill lies at your feet.  Several broken and    
rusted weapons also lie scattered about, mute evidence that some of these    
prey, at least, tried to fight back.

Floor of the cavern~
You stand at the base of the gigantic pillar which dominates the cavern.    
Duergar move all about, concealed within their hooded robes and glancing    
suspiciously at each other.  Occasional muted whispers can be heard as    
duergar meet and conduct their trade quickly and quietly.  Above it all    
rises the sound of hammer striking metal.  The trail around the pillar    
runs east and north.

Among the forges~
Waves of heat wash over you as you enter the smithy.  Fires blaze in more    
than a dozen forges, casting an orange glow on the stone walls and forcing your    
eyes to water as they adjust from the darkness of the caves.  Heavily-muscled,    
bare-chested duergar stand at every forge, pounding away with large hammers.    
Barrels of water and oil for tempering metal stand at every forge next to    
stacks of completed weapons.  The sharp sound of hammers striking anvils fills    
the air and echoes off the stone walls.

The air is heavy with moisture, and the constant sound of dripping water    
surrounds you.  Among the piles of stones, up the walls, and even on the

metal from the city forges has been completely silenced upon passing beneath    
the arch way.  The magically-formed tunnels lead north and west.

The summoning chamber~
A faint haze of smoke permeates this dimly-lit room.  Dominating the room is    
a large, elaborate pentagram covering most of the floor.  Its lines appear to    
have been pain-stakingly drawn in a dried, dark red substance, directly on to    
the stones.  A small candle stands at each tip of the pentagram, the flames    
apparently suspended in space without flickering.  The edges of the summoning    
circle glow with their own light.

suggesting it was later shaped by hand.  The walls and ceiling remain jagged    
and roughly-cut while the floor has been worn smooth.  The sounds of hammers    
striking metal echo faintly from the city, as you draw closer to the quieter    
caves holding the private sleeping quarters of the duergar.  You can follow    
the tunnel to the west, or head back south to the city.  A slightly rusted    
iron plaque is mounted on the far wall.

Above a mine shaft~
Due to the massive cloud of dust floating about, you feel the urge to cough as    
you reach the entrance to the duergar mining facilities.  A large winch is    
attached to a lift and counter weight, allowing heavy loads to be easily raised    
and lowered through the shaft.  It appears, however, to be broken at the moment,    
by the mass of twisted metal that was once the gearing mechanism.  Down seems    
to lead to another level of the Underdark, though the broken lift leaves it    
unpassable at the moment, while the rest of the city lies to the south.

This naturally forming arch has been further shaped by hand.  By some sort    
of magic, the etchings on its surface glow faintly.  The symbols of the three    
duergar clans can be seen along with several dragons and creatures of the    
Abyss.  At the top, a large dragon of unknown color coils itself around a    
wicked looking axe.  A pair of large adamantite gates lie to the west.

duergar to walk next to each other, and the ceiling spans ten feet; cramped    
for a giant perhaps, but quite profound for the short, stocky duergar.  The

The palace corridor~
This corridor is barren of any distinguishing marks, simply consisting of    
chiseled stone surfaces.  Its width is great enough to allow half a dozen    
duergar to walk next to each other, and the ceiling spans ten feet, cramped    
for a giant perhaps, but quite profound for the short, stocky duergar.  The    
distant sounds of the city proper can be heard dimly, most of the din shut out    
by the heavy gates.  The corridor leads north and east, and you notice a    
barred iron door lies to the south.  Straining your ears, you almost think you    
hear a faint scream from beyond the door, but you can not be certain.

A stairwell~
Winding steps have been carved into the stone here, leading down into the    
darkness.  The walls are extremely narrow, almost forcing you to turn sideways    
to descend.  The stone is roughly carved, leaving jagged points to tear at your    
skin and clothing.  A foul, rotten smell drifts up from below, accompanied by    
the occasional moan or scream of some creature.

you doubt two duergar could walk next to each other without rubbing shoulders.    
Aside from the claustrophobic feeling this tunnel's narrow walls impart, its

occasional pained moan can be heard, and you think you hear a muffled scream

The tunnel ends in this small, roughly-shaped room.  A small table and one    
chair for the guard stand against the wall, the rooms only furnishings.  A

padlock.

The purpose of this large room is immediately apparent upon entering.  A    
table stands in the middle of the room with several leather straps and buckles.    
On the far wall you see a rack with chains, and a wheel and gears for stretching    
victims.  A blacksmith's forge burns in one corner with the tips of several    
iron pokers in the flames, turning an angry red.  You also see a shelf off to    
one side holding miscellaneous items, vials, jars, and needles.  A rack of    
knives and other wicked looking cutting implements hangs by the door.  It's not    
a place you would wish to visit for long.

of the surface.  A large green emerald fills one of the dragon's eye sockets,    
while the other socket, which appears to have once held its twin, lies empty.

least, to allow cautious climbing.  A small opening in the rock provides an exit

The huge cave housing the duergar throne room has been expertly crafted,    
forming a huge domed ceiling with several stalagtites carved into ornate    
pillars, and several tapestries and banners hanging from the walls, obviously    
not ofduergar origin.  Along the base of the walls stand exotic suits of armor    
and weapons from many different races and kingdoms.  The majority are     
obviously from other Underdark races such as dark-elves and svirfnebli, but an    
almost equal number of items appear to stem from dwarven craftsmanship, the     
racial hatred between the duergar and their distant kin stemming back     
countless centuries.  Several small magical torches provide rare light to this    
room.

aside for the duergar king.  A large bed which appears to be constructed of    
actual wood stands against one wall, though you have no idea where they found    
the materials for such a thing in the Underdark.  Several chests and shelves    
stand about the room, most holding personal effects and such, including a rack    
of various cruel-looking weapons against one wall.  A small door leads south,

A large study~
Smaller than the first room, the study is dominated by an ornately carved    
stone desk against one wall.  On it rests an unlit candle and several papers,    
along with a mithril carving of a large dragon.  The entire south wall of the    
cave is covered with a huge woven tapestry of apparently elven make, depicting    
a large battle in a woodland scene between elves and dark-elves.

The palace corridor~
This corridor is barren of any distinguishing marks, simply consisting of    
chiseled stone surfaces.  Its width is great enough to allow half a dozen    
duergar to walk next to each other, and the ceiling spans ten feet, cramped    
for a giant perhaps, but quite profound for the short, stocky duergar.  This    
part of the corridor is dead silent, the sounds of conversation and the forges    
cut off by the solid stone all around you.  The corridor extends to the east    
and west.
