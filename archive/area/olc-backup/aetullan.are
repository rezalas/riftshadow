Ath'ashe Road~
The people meandering down the road are a mixed lot of people.  Tourists make    
up the majority of those walking toward the Glass Tower, while messengers and    
members of assorted guilds move in both directions.  The tower itself casts    
long shadows across parts of the street, its presence dominating the entire    
city of Aetullan.  Few citizens roam along this portion of the city, as little    
brings them out from their own cozy district.

Approaching a Great Tower~
Large groups of tourists stand in awe at the large structure that towers over    
them.  A magical aura pulses from its very presence, making some of the    
resident mages even stop and stare with wonder.  The air is heavy with silence,    
those who are visitors and those who are citizens well aware of how important    
the studies inside the tower truly are.

The smell of fresh stew lingers in the air as it wafts from the small pot    
hanging over the northern fireplace.  It seems like a strange commodity to    
have inside a chapel such as this, but even such a simple meal can truly be    
heavenly to the homeless that beg outside the doors.  A small wooden altar    
rests near the southern wall, a few blankets and loaves of bread waiting to    
be donated to the needy at its feet.

The insides of the building are shady and rough, looking more like a tavern     
in a dangerous part of the city rather than a guild.  The northern wall sports     
a beat up bar, half empty barrels slumped along side like old men at a watering    
hole.  A few broken stools have been tossed carelessly to one side of the    
guild, evidence that even those who claim to work on the same side cannot be    
trusted.

Shadows rise and fall with the flickering of torches inside this large and    
dirty cavern.  It looks as if it could crumble and cave in at any moment, but    
despite this fact, numerous dark clad figures peer out from the darkness.  A    
few stools are set off to one corner, out of the way of any skirmishes that    
might occur.  A small ladder leads back up to the surface, through a small     
hole in the ceiling.

Darkness consumes much of the guild hall with the exception of a few well

entrance, when it can be seen that they aren't shadows at all, but members of    
the guild. The walls, floors, the entire hall has been picked clean of anything    
that might be deemed valuable, and even some of the thieves here are eyeing up    
each others' things.

the guild is closed to new students.  Some brightly colored rugs are scattered    
on the floor and the wooden bookshelves that cover most of the walls have been    
picked through and emptied by the students.  An armchair or two take residence    
in the corners, and a large table with several chairs fills the center of the

Within the Sorcerers' Guild~
A strange force field barely to the unaided eye has been placed on everything    
inside the guild hall.  Tables and chairs, bookshelves and tomes that may have    
been destroyed by any one of the elements and quasi-elements cast forth by one    
of the students have been unharmed.  A haze of smoke fills most of the room's    
open spaces, a product of some student's magical abilities.

Entrance to the Sorcerers' Guild~
The outside of this small stone tower looks to have weathered all sorts of    
elemental storms.  A etched sign hangs over the entrance and while it doesn't    
appear to have faired as well as the rest of the exterior, it is still barely    
readable.  Bright flashes of light illuminate the doorway now and then as the    
mages inside practice their forces.

The strange black tower here looks to have been formed out of one single piece   
of volcanic glass, its surface smooth and shiny.  Aside from the tower's    
coloring and size, it bears the closest resemblance of all the mage guilds in    
Aetullan to the Glass Tower.  A few words appear perfectly engraved near the    
arched doorway, the reflective glass making it only visible when viewed from

Within the Necromancers' Guild~
An almost unbearable stench clings to the air inside the tower.  The walls are   
a glossy black stone much like the exterior of the structure, and the few    
candles and various other light sources reflect off the wall's surfaces.  The    
few tables and chairs in the guild seem to be made of the same material as the    
tower itself, their every surface unblemished and smooth.  A small stairway is    
tucked away in the corner of the guild, leading higher.

Talnya's Treasure-Trove~
The air inside this quaint little store smells sweet with perfume, as well it     
should considering all the different bottles lined up on the shelves behind the    
counter.  Several cases are stacked on the shelves as well, their contents    
still unknown.  Many different kinds of jewelry and heirlooms can be seen    
through the sheet of glass that covers the counter.  A few necklaces have been

Dust blankets everything residing in the cramped space that makes up the

state of uselessness.  A few crates are stacked on top of another, their    
contents known only to the residents of this humble home, and maybe not even    
to them anymore. There is nothing in the way of lighting, and only a small    
window curtained with dirt gives any indication of the time of day outside.

It's obvious based on simple details such as the quality of the rugs that lay

whoever lives in this home is doing reasonably well in terms of money.  Long,    
exquisite curtains have been pulled away from the several windows, lending a

The smell of freshly cut meat hangs thickly in the air of this gray stone

gouges cover its surface from so much use.  Back behind the counter, several    
different types of dried meat can be seen on racks, likely the only thing sold    
here that isn't fresh. There doesn't appear to be little else to this small    
store, its sole purpose being served with just a counter top and a butcher's    
knife.

the warmth like an old couple in the sun.  Tucked against the far wall is a    
small but adequate kitchen, making the house seem cluttered.

A Small Alcove~
A few people immersed in quiet conversations enjoy this lesser traveled    
portion of the inn.  Though poorly lit, the few soft burning candles lend a    
warm glow to the cozy space and all who inhabit it.  Only one table resides in    
the tiny room, its wooden surface a deep mahogany color.  A small vase filled    
with white roses is all the decoration this place has or even needs, the    
beauty of it relying on its simplicity.

The Rolling Green Inn~
A little less reputable than some of the other inns in town, the Rolling Green   
has quite a varied clientele.  A few gruff patrons talk loudly over their    
steins of ale, and the common room is bustling with hired help bussing food and    
drink. Several tables and chairs are spread throughout the room, offering    
comfort and rest from tedious travels.  A small door is tucked in the eastern    
wall, somewhat hidden.

A few flickering torches cast shadows across this small and otherwise dark

have been placed over the floor.  The room is empty of decoration, and its only    
furnishings being a small self-serving bar, a table and a set of chairs.

The presence of unopened crates dominates most of the space in this storage    
area, though it's hard to tell from its current state of chaos.  It's a wonder    
that anything can be found at all, as nothing appears to be labeled.  Strangely    
enough, the smokey scent of incense fills the air, making it all the harder to    
discern much of anything inside.

The Mystical Merchant Shop~
All sorts of magical trinkets and statues line the back wall of this strange    
establishment.  Globes, mutated plants, decks of cards and anything imaginable    
can be found sold in this small, tourist attracting shop.  From the plush decor    
of the shop itself, the owner appears to be doing quite well in regards to the    
business side of things.  Most things sold here are reasonable in price to keep    
the visitors buying, but a few more expensive items are displayed in case of    
thick glass.

something more lavish would be deemed wasted.  Despite being outside its stone

Rough black stone has been stacked up to form an ugly sore of a building.  Its   
square doorway is dim and uninviting, and the grim, angry looks worn on    
members' faces as they pass in and out isn't very promising.  The stone of the    
doorway is chipped in many places, suggesting that some of the fights haven't    
made it much further.

A Trail Along The Cliff~
The view of the vast waters can be described as nothing less than breathtaking   
as the waves crash against the rocky wall of the cliff.  While very    
picturesque, it is perhaps the sounds of the dangerous sea that are the most    
brilliant, their echoes making all else seem moot.  Gusts of wind threaten to    
toss anything here over the edge at any given time.

A Trail To The Cliff~
Sparse grasses and brush have been beaten back over time by the passage of    
many  travelers hoping to catch a glimpse of the sea's unmatchable beauty.     
More rocky terrain takes over the ground with every step closer to the cliff,    
as if to warn of the dangerous conditions that standing at the edge entails.     
Nothing seems to stir along the trail, insects and four-legged wildlife    
content to remain hidden for now.

A Quiet Trail~
Thick-leaved trees and the full undergrowth shelter all sounds of the city and   
sea from the tunnel-like passage.  The trail itself is rather hard to find,    
what with the natural surroundings blocking out most of the light that would    
otherwise make its way to the floor of the sparse forest.  The path is a soft    
one, cushioned by a lush layer of grass that manages to grow here despite the    
darkness.  The trees thin out to the north.

Overlooking The Sea~
The waters below crash against the side of the cliff violently, impressing on   
the fact that this is not a calm ocean.  The surroundings on the cliff are just    
as impressive, trees looming to form a small shelter.  A few wild flowers grip    
the soil, intent to remain despite the winds that whip up from the unruly sea.    
A few boulders have been carved out to make a bench to make the onlookers more

Taften Road~
Merchants and commoners pass each other by in the crowded streets of this    
mystical city.  Talk of magic pours out from the mouths of the citizens like    
water from a fountain, faces beaming with pride and love for their hometown.    
Strange features and thick accents are commonplace in the city, as the Glass    
Tower draws visitors from all walks of life throughout Shalar.  A few artists    
of various trades complete the scene of grand city life, struggling to make    
coin here and there from the tourists.

A somewhat different clientele inhabits this portion of Aetullan, the guilds    
of all sorts kinds of trades taking up residence closer to the magical heart of     
the city.  The bustle of traffic has thinned out through here, yet the tension     
increases with every accidental meeting of enemies.  Here and there a merchant    
will pass by offering wares or a citizen will scurry past, running daily    
errands. For being inside a city built around magic, it seems odd that nary a    
mage passes through here.

A somewhat different clientele inhabits this portion of Aetullan, the guilds    
of all sorts kinds of trades taking up residence closer to the magical heart of     
the city.  The bustle of traffic has thinned out through here, yet the tension     
increases with every accidental meeting of enemies.  Here and there a merchant    
will pass by offering wares or a citizen will scurry past, running daily    
errands. For being inside a city built around magic, it seems odd that nary a    
mage passes through here.

At the Intersection of Alesh and Shaln Roads~
A strange feeling fills the air in this portion of Aetullan.  Men and women    
pass by, adorned in robes and gowns as if they were a part of some royal court.    
Very few citizens or merchants make their way along the street as the district    
is regarded as one of great importance.  Groups of gawking visitors stroll past    
occasionally, however, taking in the sight of the towering home to the Scions.    
The street itself seems to swirl and eddy, mystical energies tingling beneath    
a clear, solid seal.

At the Intersection of Alesh and Jeraweth Roads~
A strange feeling fills the air in this portion of Aetullan.  Men and women    
pass by, adorned in robes and gowns as if they were a part of some royal court.    
Very few citizens or merchants make their way along the street as the district    
is regarded as one of great importance.  Groups of gawking visitors stroll past    
occasionally, however, taking in the sight of the towering home to the Scions.    
The street itself seems to swirl and eddy, mystical energies tingling beneath    
a clear, solid seal.

Jeraweth Road~
The people meandering down the road are a mixed lot of people.  Tourists make   
up the majority of those walking toward the Glass Tower, while messengers and    
members of assorted guilds move in both directions.  The tower itself casts    
long shadows across parts of the street, its presence dominating the entire    
city of Aetullan.  Few citizens roam along this portion of the city, as little    
brings them out from their own cozy district.

Approaching a Great Tower~
Large groups of tourists stand in awe at the large structure that towers over   
them.  A magical aura pulses from its very presence, making some of the    
resident mages even stop and stare with wonder.  The air is heavy with silence,    
those who are visitors and those who are citizens well aware of how important    
the studies inside the tower truly are.
