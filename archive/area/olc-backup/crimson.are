guardian chief~
the Island Guardian~
A savage Guardian is here wearing an elaborate headdress.       
~
This is the guardian of this small island.  He is quite a large man.         
For the most part he is dressed in very simple clothing, except for the        
elaborate headdress he wears.  You aren't really sure why he wears it.         
Maybe it just makes him feel important.

This is a fairly small rabbit.  It looks to be very thin and under

of darker fur.  It has a small white tail and its ears are trying       
to stand up straight but they don't quite.  His ears twitch as you

It is rather odd to sea a duck sitting out in a large body of water

brown color except at the tips of his wings, which have a slightly blue       
color.

This is not a large shark by any means.  Even so it is still a shark.       
This shark is swimming closer to the bottom of the sea darting back       
and forth around a small area of the sea floor.  Its body is a light       
gray-brown color and it has some darker strips running up its back.       
Occasionally the shark swims toward you and you are able to see its        
many rows of teeth.  Approach this shark carefully unless you don't       
like your limbs.

It appears vulnerable in comparison to its harsh environment.  Ignoring the

atrophied organs do the creature any good in this environment.  Long        
whisker-like feelers stretch out in front of it, constantly probing its

swells must be nearly eight feet deep and the constant rocking leaves        
you feeling a bit ill.  The water stings as it hits your eyes. The only        
other life present is the occasional sea creature swimming near you or        
a bird circling overhead.

Large waves crash up against jagged rocks here.  The water swirls

around in the water, perhaps from ships that have been smashed on the        
rocks.  A large rock here or there pokes up out of the water making        
this area very treacherous.  Better be careful or you won't make it to

the Cimar harbor.  Never in your life have you been so happy to see        
land.  As the harbor approaches you can see the citizens of Cimar

Various small fishing craft can be seen as you leave the Cimar dock.         
Gulls and an assortment of finches circle overhead.  The strong smell        
of saltwater fills your nose as the surf breaks at your feet.  The        
ground and all of the earth around you is a dark shade of red.  You can        
only assume this is because of the massive iron deposits nearby.

As you continue near the shore you notice a great deal of ships to your

Cimar.  The water is rough and you find yourself wondering if you

This area of the sea, while still rough, seems calmer than the rest of        
the raging body of water. Every now and then you see a giant turtle or        
some other sea creature sunning itself at the surface. This area seems        
to be much more shallow than the rest of the sea.  As you look down you        
can observe large boulders sitting on the sea floor.

The Island Guardian's Refuge~
You are high on a cliff on the north-eastern part of the island.  There       
is a truly beautiful view of the entire sea from here.  You can see the       
cliffs marking the beginning of Cimar to the north, and the cities        
docksto the west.  You feel lost in the grandeur this great place.         
Waves crash against the rocks below the cliffs, spraying up to this        
height.  An enormous throne captures your attention.  The giant who        
rules from this mighty throne must truly be a powerful man.  To either        
side of the throne stands a large red banner with some strange markings        
written on them.  The cliffs around this place make it suicidal to go        
any direction but south.

Finally solid ground.  You are walking on the slightly red sands of a

there is tall grasses all around.  Everything seems to have taken on a        
slight red tint, like the water of the sea.  The noise of the raging        
waters of the sea seems to quiet here, and the sun seems to come        
through the clouds just a bit.  This island is a completely opposite of

storm.  A feeling of peace comes from this island.

As you continue walking about the ground turns more rocky on this part        
of the island.  A few larger rocks lie about and the grasses are more        
sparse, finding few cracks in the rock to take root in.  A few trees        
are rooted into the rock making large cracks open up.  The rock is a        
deep red color, much darker that that of the sands or water of the sea.        
A small path has been worn into the rock leading to the north.  As you        
follow the path with your eyes you make out a large throne sitting in        
the middle of a clearing in that direction.  To the east the sheer        
cliff makes way to the ocean, though you wouldn't want to try and go        
that way because of the several large rocks that would hurt somewhat to        
land on.  The rocky ground leads off to more cliffs to the south.

The currents are very strong making navigation difficult.  In the

slim. Perhaps you will be lucky enough to run into a friendly ship.

The shore of a small island~
You are walking on the slightly red sands of a small island.  Behind        
you lies the rough waters of the sea.  Hopefully you won't need to        
return there soon.  Many trees can be seen a little farther on shore to        
the south, and there is tall grasses all around.  Everything seems to        
have taken on a slight red tint, like the water of the sea.  The noise        
of the raging waters of the sea seems to quiet here, and the sun seems        
to come through the clouds just a bit.  This island is a completely        
opposite of the sea that surrounds it.  It is like a calm in the middle        
of a raging storm.  A feeling of peace comes from this island.  To the        
east the trees seem to thicken somewhat and the grasses become more        
dense.  There is no discernible way to go into the foliage, so you        
might as well just push your way through.  The red sands of the beach        
continues to the north and south.

On a small island~
You are standing in the middle of what amounts to a small forest.  Many        
trees grow all around you and grass is growing everywhere that a tree        
is not.  All of the foliage has a bit of a red color to it, more-so        
than that of the plants along the beaches.  The ground is firmer here        
that that of the sand.  You can even see a patch of rock here or there        
in the grass.  You here the sounds of a small bird or two coming from        
somewhere in one of the trees.  Off the north-east you see a rise        
in the island that is rather barren looking.  In all directions that        
foliage starts to thin out and you can start to hear the sounds of the        
waves coming onto shore.

On a cliff overlooking the sea~
As you continue walking about the ground turns more rocky on this part        
of the island.  A few larger rocks lie about and the grasses are more        
sparse, finding few cracks in the rock to take root in.  A few trees        
are rooted into the rock making large cracks open up.  The rock is a        
deep red color, much darker that that of the sands or water of the sea.        
To the east the sheer cliff makes way to the ocean, though you wouldn't        
want to try and go that way because of the several large rocks that        
would hurt somewhat to land on.  The rocky ground leads off to more

Rough waters near some cliffs~
The waters of the sea are very violent here.  On two sides there are        
huge rocks that the waves crash into mercilessly.  You should try and        
stay away from them or else you might get hurt.  You are almost        
defended by the nose of the water crashing about.  The water becomes        
slightly more calm to the south, but to the east and west it is just as        
bad.

You can no longer see shore as you continue along the rough water.  The        
swells must be nearly eight feet deep and the constant rocking leaves        
you feeling a bit ill.  The water stings as it hits your eyes. The only        
other life present is the occasional sea creature swimming near you or

The currents are very strong making navigation difficult.  In the

around here is filled with weeds and they have all taken on the same        
red color that the water has.  The chance of seeing other people seems        
slim. Perhaps you will be lucky enough to run into a friendly ship.

The Western Sea~
This area of the sea, while still rough, seems calmer than the rest of        
the raging body of water. Every now and then you see a giant turtle or        
some other sea creature sunning itself at the surface. This area seems        
to be much more shallow than the rest of the sea.  As you look down you        
can observe large boulders sitting on the sea floor.

You are now below the surface of the sea.  The red waters completely

to have a slight salty taste to it.  As you look up you can see the        
turbulent waves rolling past occasionally carrying various pieces        
of flotsam along.  The sun manages to break through the clouds now       
and then sending a ray of light down through the water.  The darkness       
of the water makes it hard to see more than a few feet in any        
direction.  From time to time you feel something against your leg.         
Though you can't be sure if it is seaweed or something more        
disagreeable.

Under the sea~
You are now below the surface of the sea.  The red waters completely       
envelope you.  The water is quite cold against your skin and it seems       
to have a slight salty taste to it.  As you look up you can see the        
turbulent waves rolling past occasionally carrying various pieces        
of flotsam along.  The sun manages to break through the clouds now       
and then sending a ray of light down through the water.  The darkness       
of the water makes it hard to see more than a few feet in any        
direction.  From time to time you feel something against your leg.        
Though you can't be sure if it is seaweed or something more        
disagreeable.

An alcove overlooking the sea~
This is the example description.  Jagged rocks below you break the foamy    
crimson waves, sending the pungent scent of wet earth and sea water into the    
air.  The cliff stands to the west where a dark cave opens its maw to emit a    
loud a loud roaring noise with the help of the salty wind coming off of the    
sea.  Up above you the lies the edge of the cliff.
