Robed in black, the Afskyelige priest tends to the needs of the temple.      
Abducted at birth, the Afskyelige are brought to the temple's inner sanctum,      
where they are not seen for years.  When they emerge, they appear seemingly      
devoid of thought and emotion, as the mindless keepers of the temple.  Upon      
reaching the ago of six, they return to the inner sanctum and are never      
seen again.

citizens wander in and out of the city.  As the creature glances at you, you      
feel a deep tearing of your soul.  It passes as the creature looks away.  You      
shudder to think this is the destiny of any criminal caught within these      
walls.

The Cobbler's Shack~
A run down shack barely stands here.  Its wooden walls lean against the      
surrounding buildings for support, and you worry about your safety as you      
enter.  A makeshift counter is here, formed out of crates and a thin slice      
of birch wood.  Although poor, the cobbler has a good reputation for fine      
work within this city.

You notice that there are many more guards on the western towers than on      
the other towers surrounding the city.  The guards posted on these towers      
grimace at your arrival, hoping you are a replacement.  The wind is strong      
here, and the guards have constructed a temporary shelter which does nothing      
more than channel the wind away from them.  Heavy black cauldrons are      
settled amongst the merlons, and archer slits angle onto the plains below.      
A small wooden ladder leads down into the base of the tower.

yourself a spot and wait for an instructor....

Jutting out of the thick grating, huge spikes fend off would-be assailants.      
Archer's slits look down into the gateway, to finish off any unfortunate
