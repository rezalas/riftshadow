the village blacksmith~
A short, heavily muscled dwarf hammers viciously at his anvil here.     
~
This dwarf is covered head to foot in a black mixture of soot and sweat,     
the latter of which courses in rivulets down his face and torso. His hammer     
flies in seeming uncontrolled fury, yet each stroke lands with purpose upon     
the red-hot iron slowly shaping to the smith's will.

more potent liquors.

This peasant is the perfect workhorse for the noblemen of the northern      
cantrevs- face expression is carefully neutral, though the eyes show     
years of toil and sorrow, simply eking out what sorry existence remains.

preparation.  She is grilling meats, turning bread, frying bacon, slicing     
vegetables, and peeling potatoes with efficacy to be admired by a drill

The people who roam the northern lands belong to different worlds- the      
serfs and peasants who seek the shelter of the cantrev lords, and the      
merchants and peddlers, those who seek freedom and perhaps even danger.     
The herd is never easy, with thieves, animal predators, even the      
occasional young dragon seeking its first kill.  It is a lonely lifestyle,     
and one given certainly to contemplation.

Joyful, ye steadfast, ye brave:     
     
"In rampant night and darkened valley     
 the faithful from their homes were driven;     
 The spears of honor, love and might     
 were shattered, brake, and riven."     
     
"We sought ne'er once this fury bound     
 We gave our hails to peace     
 In time of war we asked no more     
 than to be buried with quiet honor."     
     
"Yea, children found with haste and fear     
 the terror was no illusion;     
 The clash of heathen and righteous men     
 The blood spilt for our freedom."     
     
"Our fathers walked as champions alone     
 'twixt nightmare rounds of war     
 outmatched, outnumbered;     
 ne'er to fly from the face of battle     
 staying the course of heroes' mettle."     
     
Chorus:     
     
"Joyful, ye steadfast, ye brave     
 beyond the night;     
     
 The eyes of Heaven mark well your     
 tread, and grant ye holy might;     
     
 A thousand strong may run thee far     
 A hundred drive ye fair to the sea;     
     
 But not once ye waver in heart or soul;     
 Yea, the Heavens favour thee!"

It has been some time since I last heard from you.  I have been     
working day and night on the plan, and I grow weary of wondering what     
aid I can expect when I move against this buffoon of a cantrev-lord.     
He's taken recently to calling himself a King, did you hear that?  His     
arrogance sickens me and my followers more every day.  I will lead the     
bandit swordsmen in, as planned.  I must receive your communique,      
however, to know that we are not compromised and found out!  Remember,

us all!

Metal implements for shaving, smelting, and shaping are strewn about on

You stand before a large way-post maintained by the Cimar Army's     
prestigious Border Patrol.  A wooden barricade with stakes tipped with     
razor-sharp steel is dug in awaiting a horde of brigands, or goblins,     
or anything to keep the patrolmen in practice.  On either side of you,     
deep green pastures open up, thanks to the nearby river valley's      
fertility.  The road branches here, one continuing north, and another     
leading west.  A large wooden sign sits next to the barricade.

Inside the tanner's home~
You stand inside the modest wooden cabin of the tanner.  Here, it     
seems that the entire house has been converted into a cookery for the     
despondent and the homeless- though Koteras sports quite few of those.     
Cooking firepits and fireplaces are set strategically throughout the      
entire home.  Beside that, a huge wooden chair dominates the central     
floor of the home, looking large enough to hold even the master of the     
house.

A small slaughterhouse~
This small cabin is fitted with a stone chimney and several layers     
of cowhide tenting to allow meats to be smoked in the center of the     
building, while packages of cooked meat meant for the trail lay on     
shelves encircling the center.  A large cutting table in the center     
of the room shows countless knife- and cleaver-marks, and a large     
pen in the back of the building holds a collar and cage to slaughter     
livestock.

A road of whitened earth~
Here, the trail of white earth seems to stretch out for a while     
to the west, but the road itself turns southward, next to a wooden     
longhouse to your immediate west. The building is austere but well     
maintained, and shows the mark of the Border Patrol.

A dirt road~
You stand upon a dirt road leading south from Koteras village's     
main east-west thoroughfare, the white road.  The trail you stand upon     
rejoins it to the north, and also leads south to meet the door of     
the wooden longhouse that rests immediately to your west.

You stand on a dirt road directly east of a large, guarded door that     
serves the Border Patrol who must maintain at least an adequate garrison     
even this far out simply to combat banditry and highwaymen.  The door     
and the longhouse itself are nothing special, well kept but simple.       
However, the men who occupy its walls are nothing if not exceptional.

A small garden~
By order of the Cimar Army, the Patrolmen who serve in the outlying     
lands must also pursue a given hobby, to encourage good morale and to     
strengthen their bond with the native land they are called upon to      
defend, to possibly give their life for.  Here, the men of the Patrol     
are given tasks in raising certain herbs that flavor food, heal the ill,     
and mostly produce a better smell for most of the town.  All manner     
of cheap herbs grow in abundance here, tended by the Army.

for the men of Koteras Patrol, and they utilize it well.  A pair of     
soldiers dice in the corner, while others sleep or polish their      
already-impeccable armor.  A bookshelf rests against the western wall.

northern brigade.  A young lieutenant, his desk is a folderol of      
written march orders, disciplinary procedures, squad and platoon     
assignment dispatches, and small nicks and scars where a sharp,     
frustration-driven dagger may have found its way.  A small, yet     
comfortable bed rests in the southeast corner of the room atop a     
large floor rug.

Northern division of the Border Patrol.  Runners stop in every couple     
of seconds, couriers drop by every OTHER second, and the Captain's      
desk seems a veritable cornucopia of papers, orders, and dispatches.     
Despite this, it actually seems that the man has everything in order!     
Miraculously, every page that crosses his hands finds the perfect      
place in the piles, and the business of the region is conducted with     
Cimarian efficiency.

north-south or east-west roads that converge at the town well.  Here     
it is somewhat quiet and removed from the hustle of business.

gossip tells of a great historian and public figure who inhabits the     
house, but also that he has not been seen for years.

neatly in a wardrobe on the eastern wall, and a small desk sits in
