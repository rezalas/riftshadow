Mid-air~
You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of DikuMUD.      
The result of such a foolish act should be punished with death, you know.      
With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you      
are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to      
be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.      
      
You've fallen, and you can't get up!!!

This is an utterly silent place. As you look around you see that there      
hasn't been a living thing in a long time. The dust lies here in a thick      
layer on the floor and on the furniture. On the wall hangs a bleak and       
worn tapestry. A winding stone staircase leads up into darkness. On the       
wall to the west you can see a huge torch stuck into the solid rock.      
A large portcullis blocks your way to the north.

The narrow ledge~
You are in the progress of walking all the way around the ledge since there's      
no way of turning around on this all too narrow path. There IS another exit      
from here but that leads right into mid-air and with high probability of a      
free fall session afterwards.

The southwestern corner of the ledge~
This seems like a ledge that is a little broader than the one just to the       
north of here. The ledge seems to lead around some sort of Abyss of total       
darkness. The ledge seems to have an odd-looking edge here.

The Abyss lies down there. Who knows what might lurk down there?      
~
E rock~
It looks as if it can be opened in a door-like fashion. Maybe this will lead      
the way down.      
~
E step~
A small rock sticks out right under it, otherwise the way is DOWN, DOWN, and      
SPLAT!!!      
~
E edge odd-looking~
This is truly a weird piece of craftsmanship in your eyes. The edge seems to      
form a step leading down, but WHAT a STEP DOWN. The Abyss opens down there       
leading to seemingly total destruction.

An odd intersection~
You stand in a rather odd intersection of pipes. The pipes actually don't      
resemble pipes anymore. They look more like a real stone tunnel, or a      
passageway hewn directly into the rock. The ways from here lead north, east      
and west.

Mid-air~
You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of Merc Mud.      
The result of such a foolish act should be punished with death, you know.      
With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you      
are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to      
be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.      
      
You've fallen, and you can't get up!!!

The Broad ledge~
You are standing on a ledge that seems quite a lot larger than the rest       
of the ledges. This one leads to the west and the east, plus it has an exit      
going to the south. Though you could jump into mid-air, but it probably       
wouldn't be such a good idea. The way south is in utter darkness.

secret trapdoor entrance~
~
E soil soft earth~
You can just make out the outline of a trapdoor here in the soil. The earth      
is probably there to conceal a secret entrance. This looks as if it leads down      
into the seemingly solid rock face of the ledge.      
~
E ground ledge rock~
The ground here seems a little different from all the other ledges along the      
Abyss. There's a kind of soft soil on this ledge, maybe you should look       
carefully at this. It seems to be of some interest.
