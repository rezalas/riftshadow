A frail old man is sleeping on the bed.

Perhaps finding comfort in his hidden bungalow, this old man looks at    
peace as he sleeps comfortably on his bed. He wears very little    
clothing and is completely undisturbed by your entrance. You may never    
know why he chooses to live out his life here, but certainly he must    
have his reasons.

A large bullfrog wallows in the mud.    
~
Big eyes bulge out from the top his slimy, rubbery skin, blinking every    
so often along with a load croak. It is hard to make out the bullfrog's    
true color because of the mud caked on his skin, thus you cannot be    
sure if this is the poisonous kind or not. His long legs look extremely    
powerful and you are sure they could aide him in making a hasty escape    
if you startle him.

A large crocodile rests quietly, waiting for its next victim.

For being a vicious and tough looking animal, this crocodile sure    
doesn't have to move around a whole lot to prove it. It is easily ten    
feet long and a few feet across at its widest, with skin that is    
probably thicker than any leather. You do not feel in any immediate    
danger, but it would probably be best not to disturb it.

blue-green iridescent shine. It is a relatively small bird, maybe a    
foot in height, but its ornamental tail feathers are easily two feet in    
length, making the birds seem more long and graceful.

its eyes. They seem to be able to rotate independent of one another,

This small space is completely enclosed by vines, creating what must be

the floor of the marsh creating a very peaceful and serene setting to    
witness. The trunk is twice the width of a titan, and the dome-like    
awning the tree creates is larger than many houses. Rows of smaller    
cypress trees grow to the north, west and south, but you can get a    
better view of the marsh by climbing up into the willow tree.

High in the Willow Tree~
>From here you can see above most of the marsh while for once the air    
isn't thick with humidity and insects. A strong breeze blows and it is    
good to feel that fresh air against your skin. It is almost impossible    
to see back down into the marsh in any place, and in a few spots the    
tops of the trees interlock so well as to form what appears to be the    
ground itself. There are a few taller trees which extend above the    
canopy, but you still remain at the highest point in the marsh. Odd-    
looking stone structures rise up from the marsh in all directions. The    
most unique being a pair of matching towers to the south. Some words

little light enters this ground. Rising up in the center is a    
rectangular stone monument covered in moss and vines. The ground is no    
longer the damp mud, but an ancient stone walkway coated in various    
fungi and mosses. It leads up two wide steps to what looks like an

A Murky Pool~
At what must be a low point in the marsh, the water has collected to    
form a shallow pool of standing water. With roots extended up out of    
the water, the trees still grow abundantly here. The water is coated    
with a thin film of scum, making it impossible to see far below the    
surface. To the west the pool continues, but the vines and trees are    
too dense to travel through. A small creek pours into the pool from the    
south.

On the Banks of a Pool~
The boggy trail widens as the mud becomes softer, much like a dirt    
soup. The ground slopes downward to the west towards a shallow pool in    
the marsh. Small streaks of light make it through the overhanging    
ferns, illuminating the moss covered area with a dull luster. A thick    
patch of reeds and ferns lay eastward. The bank continues to the north    
and reeds and ferns block the ways to the south and east.

An Ancient Entryway~
Two pillars on either side of you arch up to form an elegant archway    
above your head. The pillars themselves are somewhat smooth due to    
their lengthy stay in the marsh, but some of their carvings are still    
visible along their sides and tops. Once through the entryway you enter    
into a lush bird and animal paradise. Every fern and blade of grass    
seems a bit more tropical than the flora in the rest of the swamp. A    
constant chirping and singing emanates mainly from the east and a path    
through the sanctuary leads to the north, south and east.

A Decrepit Stone Fountain~
The paths throughout this sanctuary come together here to an old stone    
fountain now serving its purpose as a birdbath. The fountain is maybe    
fifteen feet in diameter and in its center is a small statue of a nymph    
frolicking. Exotic birds of all sorts don't even seem to notice you as    
they splash around the garden, singing to their heart's content. A few    
flowering plants grow around the fountain so the birds do not have to    
travel too far from their apparent happiness. A small plaque is here to    
commemorate the fountain.

continue to loom above you creating a nice canopy for shade. You hear    
the occasional bird chirp as well as odd, seemingly amphibian noise.    
Long vines hang from the trees and mosses and lichen grow an just about    
anything. The path winds to the north, weaving amidst the slime and    
muck. To the west the path opens up into a large clearing.

An Old Stone Path~
A straight line of stones cuts the way north and south of here lined on    
both sides by short overhanging trees. The path is about ten feet    
across and the stones themselves are cracked and weathered allowing    
grasses and weeds to creep through to the surface of the walkway. To    
the south is a small rusted gate leading into a garden of some sort. To    
the north the path opens into a large clearing.

An Overgrown and Decayed Garden~
A path of light colored grasses leads the way through this old garden.    
Odd-looking, dead plants and flowers lay covered in weeds and ferns.    
Instead of being an elegant natural treasure, all neat and orderly,    
this garden has transformed into a mass of rotten flowers and plants    
still in their rows, but spilling into the path in some places. The    
path through the garden leads to the east and to the south. An old

On the Muddy Creek~
A small stream of water cuts through the area. It is only a few feet    
across and not that deep, but the wide muddy banks running on either    
side of it suggest that the creek is not nearly as large as it used to    
be. A thick wall of ferns and trees line either side of the muddy    
banks, but they do not branch across and over the stream to form the    
natural canopy they do in other places in the marsh. The creek widens    
and flows into a small pool to the north and a small trail is cut    
through the trees to the south leading to a small clearing.

A Magnificent Archway~
This is what must have once been the gate to the large stone castle to    
the south. A line of pillars leads the way up to the walls of the    
archway, some fallen and some still in a decent condition. The edges of    
the wall are still somewhat smooth and intact. At its top the outline    
arcs up and comes to a sharp point. The gate itself must be at least    
thirty feet tall and half that size in width. Small hinges can be seen    
on the bottom corners of the arch from what must have been a drawbridge    
that fell over the creek to the north. Small weathered statues can be    
seen on the tops of the pillars. The main entryway lies to the south    
while a small bridge over an even smaller creek is to the north.

E statue statues~
You can make out wings on these beaten pieces of stone giving the    
appearance of gargoyles. Any significant details on the statues have    
been worn away over the years. Their mere presence suggests that the    
owners of this castle were not welcome to visitors.

On the Muddy Creek~
A small stream of water cuts through the area. It is only a few feet    
across and not that deep, but the wide muddy banks running on either    
side of it suggest that the creek is not nearly as large as it used to    
be. A thick wall of ferns and trees line either side of the muddy    
banks, but they do not branch across and over the stream to form the    
natural canopy they do in other places in the marsh. The start of the    
stream is to the east while it flows onward to the north.

Start of the Muddy Creek~
Bubbling up from the ground, a small natural spring creates the creek    
that flows through the marsh. Tall trees line the sides of this small    
stream, but they do not branch out across to one another forming a    
canopy like most places in the swamp. The creek itself is only a few    
feet wide and not deep at all. The muddy banks running along the sides    
of the water are much wider than the creek itself, suggesting that the    
creek used to be much wider than it is now. A creeks flows to the west    
and a small trail leads off through the trees to the north to a small    
clearing.

A Toppling Entryway~
Tall stone walls rise up on either side of this small corridor leading    
into the rest of the castle. At their top they come together in an    
archway, which for the most part, is still intact. The purpose of this    
space was as an extra defensive mechanism. Small windows are spaced up    
high in the walls where archers would shoot invaders who made it into    
the corridor. Since there is no gate to the north or to the south it is    
unlikely to be able to serve that purpose now. The main gate, or what's    
left of it, is to the north and a long east to west hallway is to the    
south.

The Top of a Stone Tower~
>From the top of this tower you can overview the entirety of the marsh.    
So odd that the remnants of the castle that you peer from are a mere    
bit of what once must have been extreme grandeur. How this place simply    
gave in to the will of nature and drown in this marsh is a perplexing    
thought. You can see a large will tree off to the north and the twin    
tower to the east. Back down is the only was off this unsteady tower of

Some broken steps lie in a dusty heap beneath a stairway that seems    
anything but sturdy. For how old this castle must be, it is surprising    
to see that this tower has retained most of its circular shapes. The    
stone floor is considerably cracked and small plants seep through them.

You stand at the center of a long ruined hallway. The stones in the    
floor are severely cracked in many places allowing grasses and mosses    
to seep through. From the looks of it, the entryway to the north is    
lucky to still be standing and nothing to the south of you is. It all    
lies in a massive heap of rubble and stone. The tragedy that befell    
here certainly intended not to take any prisoners. The hallway heads to    
the east and west.
