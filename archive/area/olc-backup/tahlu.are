grimalkin servant~
a grimalkin servant~
A furry servant of the palace is here, happily aiding the mages.     
~
Patchy brown fur struggles to free itself from the green robe that's wrapped     
around this grimalkin servant.  The claws on his hands are filed down slightly     
to better accommodate and manage the daily chores of the castle.  On his feet     
are a pair of short leather boots.  Contrary to popular belief, he seems quite     
content to be living and working within a stronghold of magic.

A scrawny grimalkin servant is here, dusting off the wall hangings.     
~
Stripped grey fur and bright yellow eyes stare at every inch in front of him,     
as he passes through the castle.  He wears a dark green robe and some short,     
soft leather boots, and carries a small, dirty rag in his hand.  Almost frantic     
is his dusting, and the occasional sneeze can be heard as he continues his work     
through the castle.

A grimalkin servant is here, cleaning up after the students.

Looking extremely tired and frustrated, this grimalkin is rushing around, trying     
to put some order back into the lives of the students.  He doesn't have much     
in the way of fur, but what there is of it is black and unkempt.  Like the     
other servants, he wears a robe of dark green and short boots of white leather.

A grimalkin servant is here, carrying a stack of books.

Five heavy books stacked one on top of the other burden this slightly built     
grimalkin.  Her fur is a deep chocolate color and her blue eyes peer out from

capable of carrying all the books, and then some.  Like the other servants,     
she wears a green robe tied at the waist.

Tiny compared to the rest of the staff, Nalla doesn't pay any attention     
to the things going on around her.  Pale blue eyes and a small smile make     
her endearing, and the way her green robe hangs loosely over her frame is     
reminiscent of a child in her father's clothing.  Her feet are bare, as the     
oversized boots would hinder more than help her.

A young elf is here, studying a book on transmutation.

Curly blond hair is all that can be seen of the head of Ilearil, his face     
buried deep in his book.  He is tall and slender like most elves, and his     
clothing is light and colorful.  Yellow breeches meet with the high black     
deerskin boots that lace up close to his knees, and a loose white shirt     
hangs open at the neck.  As he wanders through, he manages to keep from     
walking into anything, even though it's apparent he's not watching where     
he's going.

scarf is tied around her neck, and satin slippers of a similar color cover     
her small feet.  She holds an engraved silver pen in one hand.

and a wrinkled black robe are all he's managed to clothe himself with     
so far.  By the look of his face, he hasn't been awake for very long.

Laodrin looks relatively stonefaced today, and probably does every other day     
that passes.  For a guard, he doesn't wear much in the way of protective armor,     
only a simple robe with sleeves only as far as the elbow, tied at the waist.     
The light coating of fur on his forearms is a deep gray, and as he grips the     
sharp-looking spear in hand, the muscles in his face twitch and flex, eyes     
keeping the watch over this place.

Bright violet eyes stare out from the soft features of her porcelain     
skinned face in myriad curiosity at her surroundings, and absently she

nestles at the base of her throat, set with some kind of stone.  A     
long gray gown of fine silk covers her slight frame, and about her     
shoulders sets a heavy woolen cloak held by a small silver clasp.     
About each wrist are what looks like bracelets, but may be nothing     
more than birthmarks or scars.

slight build.  Deep brown eyes stare out in earnest, seemingly searching     
for something.  A black embroidered robe is tied about him, and a few     
rings adorn his hands.  As he paces back and forth, his hands rearrange     
their grip of the dark wooden staff in his hands.

wrists, and though she doesn't look strong enough to carry an axe, she has     
one, hefted up on her shoulder.  Tan leather boots cover her up to her knees,

His clothing is very simple, a short robe tied at the waist.  His fur is a

total awareness.  Each second of time passes by with the sound of his clear,     
crystal spear, passing from hand to hand in an almost absent manner.

A dragon formed from ice crystals stares at you with frosty eyes.

Before you stands a gigantic creature of draconic proportions.  It appears      
to be a dragon in every aspect, from its size, to the reptilian head, to      
the scales which coat its body, to its massive wings, footlong razor-sharp      
talons, or its serpentine spiked tail.  All aspects, that is, save for its      
color and compostion, for this dragon is formed of nothing but pure ice      
crystals.  At a glance it might seem nothing more than an elaborate ice      
sculpture, but with one fluid motion, that notion is dispelled, for this      
creature is very much alive and mobile.  Its eyes are large and bluish-     
white in color, with a slight rim of frost around the edge.  It regards you      
with an unblinking gaze, the weight of might well be enough to chill the      
soul of even the bravest man.

Entry 1:     
Things seem to be going alright up here.  I still contain some amount     
of bitterness toward the Scions I was formerly in league with, but     
I can understand their trepidation in welcoming me in this state.  At     
least they have allowed me complete charge of Tahluir'rethan, as I've     
no place else to go, currently.     
     
Entry 2:     
Today was slow, looking for a spot where I can place this "castle" for     
awhile... and it's lonely.  Living my life out like this wasn't how I     
had imagined it.  My efforts to remove this illusion trapping me have     
continually failed.  I can only make the best of this, as hard as it     
is to do.     
     
Entry 3:     
It occurred to me, finally, that I could do something other than spend     
my life alone, wasting away.  I will use my magics to its best ability,     
and teach others in the ways of it, and train the young.  I will leave     
this place for a little while, and search for those willing to learn.     
     
Entry 4:     
Things are looking up, at last!  I've returned bringing several eager     
grimalkin, hoping to learn more of their heritage and its connection to     
magic.  Still, the company is so welcome!  We will do well up here, I     
think.  Perhaps when we are more accustomed to each other, I will share     
my true nature with them.     
     
Entry 5:     
We recruited two young students today, of my own human descent.  They     
are bright and willing, but I think their studies will suffer due to     
the tiny babe they have brought with them.  Still, I feel the magic     
strongly in the form of little Alshida.  But it is good to have students,     
and in some ways, the remind me of what I sacrificed for the security     
of the White Tower, and all of Shalar.     
     
Entry 6:     
Eleven students now!  I can barely believe what this is becoming.  I am     
grateful to have something to keep me busy, something to create and share     
with the others.  The grimalkin are doing so well, though Nalla's birth     
was a scare for all of us.  It was a pure miracle that she survived at all,     
but at the loss of her mother... it's so very sad.  But we are all of one     
family here, and we will raise her together.     
     
Entry 7:     
Alshida was orphaned today... her parents traveled down to Sailing Stone in     
search of prospects.  I should've known they weren't ready!  I shouldn't     
have let this happen.  I have never felt the violence of the magic haters     
so strongly as I do now.  There is no love of anything in their stony hearts,     
no thoughts within their thick skulled heads.  Hopefully we can do her justice.     
Her age is close to Nalla's, perhaps it will make things easier.

Today was my first day of planning.  Bless the magics for     
this moment. Though the illusion I have built around myself     
is uncomfortable, it is what I must do to protect my studies     
and those of others.  The mannerisms of men are so easily     
portrayed, but hard to truly understand.  I need to be     
convincing.  Now, to find some way to impress upon the others...     
     
Entry 2:     
Life has been busy, and I've had few moments since my arrival     
here in Cimar to collect my thoughts.  I've managed to gain      
quite a reputation amongst the elite of society here.  Their      
pleasantries and false sincerity are appalling, I can only imagine      
how much worse it would be if they found out what I really was.       
I can see the greed, the pure evil in their eyes, while their      
smiles swell with deceptive warmth.  Something will come from      
all of this, I am certain.     
     
Entry 3:     
Today it has happened!  My struggles have paid off, and I will     
prove myself worthy of the sickening court here.  The King     
himself (though I do still despise his kind) has bestowed me     
with a grand task, one I am not even sure I can accomplish.     
His desire to devour the entire other continent is unnerving,     
and I suspect that is what he wishes this flying creation to     
be used for.  Our original suspicions are turning to reality,     
and his violent desires will surely be the death of him, someday.     
     
Entry 4:     
It is finished!  At last!  I cannot even begin to express my happiness     
and pride here on this paper.  It has been a tough seven years, building     
this magnificent thing.  My Tahluir'rethan, Gate of the Heavens.  And     
now, my espionage work is almost through... I will return to the freedoms     
of my own body, and of the world.  How I miss those places.     
     
Entry 5:     
From the library I watch as the troops travel one by one through the     
gate, on their way to what they think will be the greatest victory of     
their lifetimes.  Not so.  I have forewarned the White Tower, and these     
poor zombies called soldiers will learn their King's mistakes the     
difficult way.  And so, I hope, will the King.  It will take them     
several more hours to get everyone aboard.  I need to rest my mind.     
Controlling the wind is so draining.     
     
Entry 6:     
My mind is so weary.  I can barely see what goes on outside the window     
of this tower, but I can hear the muffled sounds of battle down below     
me.  It is done, now.  The King, his army, they are finished.  And     
I am tired.. so tired.  I must find a safe place for Tahluir'rethan to     
be.  Must return the illusions back to their true form...

way extended out to either side.  Each facet of the crystal has been     
painstakingly cut and polished, so that the statue virtually shines in     
the light.  The eyes of the statue in particular almost seem to glow with     
an internal light all their own.

E stone key large~
This key is formed out of stone, yet is of fairly intricate design.  It seems     
to have been fit to a fairly complex lock, if the teeth of the key are any     
indication.  The stone is of a bland grey rock, yet seems quite sturdy and     
solid.  Upon closer examination, it almost appears as if the key were formed     
perfectly in this shape, as there are no visible nicks or chisel marks at any     
point along the key.

The corpse here doesn't even appear normal from a distance.  A distinct aura     
of magic swirls over its surface, moving in and out of the nostrils and ears.     
Despite the masculine clothing it still wears, the corpse takes on a feminine     
shape.  Yet the aura of magic seems to flicker occasionally, the appearance of     
the corpse shifting to something more masculine, and vaguely familiar.

Before the gates~
Grand gates of some unknown material tower over you at the entrance to this     
lair.  A large white structure can be seen back behind the gates, looming its     
ominous presence for all it's worth.  Looking around yourself, you notice that     
you are not truly on solid ground: your feet seem covered in some hazy clouds,     
solidifying here and there, but not enough to hold you above without any aid of     
flight.  A small scroll hovers in the air near the gates, an aura of energy     
swirling around it.

A small path leading from the gates up to the doorway ahead seems to shimmer     
slightly with every step.  Looking to either side of you, the ground seems to     
waver, allowing an intermitten view of the sky on which this place hovers.  The     
decoration upon the large structure in front of you is rather lacking: nothing     
but shades of white and a few transparent places.

Through an arched doorway~
This doorway is large, sizing about five humans wide, standing shoulder to     
shoulder.  The archway shimmers much like the path that led you to it, singing     
of pure ivory.  The doors protecting this lair look heavy, and shimmer as well.     
Its surface is bare of any design, but as you look away to examine the rest of     
your surroundings, you swear you see something etched across it, staring out of     
the corner of your eye.  Well lit hallways cross paths here, running both east     
and west, a gallery of sorts lies to the north, and fresh air beckons to you     
from the south.

Bright spheres of light seem to hop up before you as you make your way down     
this corridor.  Misty walls lean in and out occasionally, and a framed piece of     
parchment hangs on the wall, catching your attention.  The ground below your     
feet is most peculiar: it's misty, fuzzy appearance becomes solid as your foot     
comes down upon it.  You run a hand along the walls, and they seem to do the     
same.  The ceiling, however, clearly is not solid, as waves of mist, cloud and     
even snow float down.  The hallway continues to the east and west.

wall are shelves littered with assorted combs, blankets and harnesses.  Below     
the shelves are saddles, stacked on top of each other and blanketed in dust. In

A heavy sense of disdain overwhelms you upon entering into this part of the

lined opposite along two walls, swords, axes, and other weaponry rest against     
the wooden walls.  Racks made from wood stand next to each cot, donning battle     
armor, bearing what appears to be an ancient symbol of the house of Cimar.       
Despite the apparent difference between this part of the palace and the rest     
of it, there is a strong sense of magic here.  A wooden door sets in the

E rack racks~
The wooden racks standing along each cot seem to be in much better shape than     
the cots themselves. The armor that rests on the racks are dented and tarnished,     
giving the impression that whenever they were last used, they were not taken     
care of in the proper way.  According to legend, into each breastplate, an     
ancient symbol of Cimar is etched.     
~
E cot cots~
Made from a dark wood and covered with canvas, these cots look like they     
could've withstood almost any weight or pressure, at one point in time.     
Now that disuse and deterioration have taken their toll, it looks like it     
would take more than a soft summer breeze to turn them into dust.

A bend in the hallway~
The hallway comes to a sharp turn here, and before you pass straight through     
the fuzzy walls, they solidify and bounce you gently back on track.  Bright     
spheres of light seem to hop up before you as you make your way down this     
corridor.  Misty walls lean in and out occasionally, while the ground below     
your feet is most peculiar: it's misty, fuzzy appearance becomes solid as your     
foot comes down upon it.  Near the floor, you see a small ceramic vase.  You     
run a hand along the walls, and they seem to do the same.  The ceiling, however,     
clearly is not solid, as waves of mist, cloud and even snow float down. The     
hallway continues east and south.

E painting decorative~
The frameless painting that hangs here depicts a treasured moment for any of     
the magical persuasion.  The tiny and articulated brushstrokes create a young     
mage, mousy brown hair stuck to his brow with sweat.  His clothing seems most     
real, an oversized robe of dark blue, and you can imagine this boy and his     
constant struggle to keep his sleeves above his hands.  A large open book sets     
on a pedestal before him, and his eyes and smile lighten his face at his new     
mastered spell.

E small detailed sketch~
This small sketch looks as if it was put upon the wall as an afterthought.     
It depicts the ability of shapeshifting in five stages: the first sketch,     
a normal mortal body, the second, some slight changes in the outer most     
points of the limbs.  The changes traveling further inward in the third     
sketch, and in the fourth, almost all changes in form have become visible.     
The final sketch is that of a great lion, eyes twinkling with intelligence.

A small tapestry hangs here, it's background woven with bright red cloth.     
Several waves of blue and green entwine to form a great flame, centered     
on the cloth.  Upon closer inspection, small faces and figures of silver     
colored thread stand out of the blue flames, and the same made of gold     
thread in the green flames.  Some of the expressions are angered, some in     
uncontrolled weeping.  It is certain, however, that these sides are at odds     
with each other.

Artifacts and prized scribblings mount the fuzzy white walls, though only one

The room is circular in nature, making the glowing spheres cast shadows full     
of color and odd angles.  Blues, greens, yellows make the room look full of     
life, yet there is something eerie that lingers. The air stirs through, though     
you see no visible windows or vents.  In the center of the room stands a giant     
pillar, more than ten feet in diameter.  The gallery continues to the north and

E large painting~
White on white seems to be all this painting is of, but a more careful eye     
shows differently.  Hidden in a raging storm of wind and snow is a pale and     
scruffy looking man.  His eyes are barely visible beneath his white eyebrows,     
and his hair and long beard are ragged and similar in color.  His robes are     
also white, and bundled tightly around him.  A look of deep concentration     
covers his face, as he attempts to control the storm around him.  The frame     
of this picture is made of a white crystal, etched in the shape of snowflakes.     
~
E pillar~
The surface is smooth like marble, but when you put your hand to it, you know     
it isn't something natural.  It is cold to the touch, so much that it feels as     
though it is burning.  Some sort of unseen force seems to throb from this huge     
fixture, almost as if it breathes, lives.  The lights the room seem to throb     
with it, and you wonder at what strange power resides in this place.

Carved by means that must surely be magical, the stone figure is frozen in     
a moment, mouth opened wide in a scream of anger or hatred, likely both.  His     
attire is simple, only the toe of his boots peek out from under a full length     
robe.  An arm is stretched out toward the center of the room, the carefully     
carved sleeve pushed up to the elbow.  His palm is faced outward, and a few     
rings are engraved into the stone fingers.  The facial features of this man     
are simple stunning, his hair is much the same, long and unbound around the     
shoulders.  Mounted on the wall next to the statue is a plaque.

The gallery~
Artifacts and prized scribblings mount the fuzzy white walls.  The room is     
circular in nature, making the glowing spheres cast shadows full of color     
and odd angles.  Blues, greens, yellows make the room look full of life,     
yet there is something eerie that lingers.  The air stirs through, though     
you see no visible windows or vents.  In the center of the room stands a     
giant pillar, more than ten feet in diameter.  A tapestry covers the wall     
here.  The gallery continues to the north and south.

The tragedy of Alhak Shareev'm Tasaia.     
~
E tapestry~
While this woven article is certainly big, it's not all that interesting.     
The background is different shades of green and blue, and dozens of strange     
symbols and letters in yellow cover the majority of it.  The only clue to     
what it could possibly mean is the small plaque hanging next to it.     
~
E pillar~
The surface is smooth like marble, but when you put your hand to it, you know     
it isn't something natural.  It is cold to the touch, so much that it feels as     
though it is burning.  Some sort of unseen force seems to throb from this huge     
fixture, almost as if it breathes, lives.  The lights the room seem to throb

A small circular room~
Here you are within the center of the very structure, the giant pillar caught     
your eye as you explored the palace.  The walls that surround you are extremely     
smooth to the touch, made of fine white marble.  A small wooden desk sits      
against one wall, gathering dust.  Warmth seems to emit from the very walls      
in invisible waves, wrapping around you, rendering you silent.  A throb of      
energy fills the room, making the walls look alive. The noise grows louder and      
louder, echoing into your sensitized ears.  The throbbing suddenly lessens in      
its intensity, leaving you with a sense of awe.  You think you see a tiny      
spiralling stairway tucked away to one side.

A dark skinned woman is the focus of this piece.  Her hair is a short, brown     
color, as are her narrowed eyes.  She adorns a white, fur-lined robe and a     
small pendant hangs around her neck.  Her face sharp with angles, her nose     
and chin too pointed, cheeks too hollow, giving her a grim look.

Carved entirely from ice, it's a wonder it itself that this large block     
hasn't melted yet, or shown any signs that it will in the future.  The     
arms and back are chiseled into elaborate curves and angles, reflecting     
light around the room.  It looks horribly uncomfortable.

stuff, yet they show no signs of melting despite the relative warmth of the     
air in here.  As you walk through the tower, you notice that the floor is not     
slippery as one might expect, but you are able to keep your steps firmly on     
the ground without a problem.  A few windows look out upon the surrounding sky     
and clouds, reminding you just how far up you really are.  You see more of the

The stairs here are once again made of the cloudlike substance that you found

solidify with every step you make upon this stairway.  The stairs themselves     
are rather narrow, as if made for those with much smaller feet than the average     
human.  The stairway itself is tight wound, not allowing for much movement other     
than following the stairs up or down.  More of the tower spreads to the west and     
south from here.

the ground without a problem.  A few windows look out upon the surrounding sky     
and clouds, reminding you just how far up you really are.  The tower continues     
to the east, west and north, and to the south you see a small hallway.

A crystalline tower~
The ground beneath your feet and the structure of the entire tower, looks to     
be made from solid ice.  The walls look to be made from blocks of the frosty     
stuff, yet they show no signs of melting despite the relative warmth of the     
air in here.  As you walk through the tower, you notice that the floor is not     
slippery as one might expect, but you are able to keep your steps firmly on     
the ground without a problem.  A few windows look out upon the surrounding sky     
and clouds, reminding you just how far up you really are.  To the west the tower     
continues, and to the north you see a spiral stairway.

A large bedroom~
Brightly colored rugs made of woven canvas and cloth lay scattered upon the     
sturdy looking floor of the large sleeping quarters.  Magical lights send some     
colorful patterns against the relatively plain cloudy walls.  Numerous beds     
line the walls, covered in soft blankets filled with down, and fluffy pillows.     
Stacks of thickly bound books are piled near just about every bed, and a few     
are lined upon the sparse bookshelves along one wall.  Three or four desks have     
made their home in this room as well, beckoning you to sit down and study the     
art that is Magic.  The bedroom sprawls out to the south and east.

A short hallway~
The hallway looks similar to that of the downstairs halls, walls fuzzily waver     
between solidity and a cotton texture.  The decor of this portion of the exotic     
mansion is drab, nothing more than necessary, as it is mainly for the use of     
students and other regular visitors.  A few modest paintings make the walls seem     
a little less bare, and a rough and practical rug runs down the middle of the     
floor.  The hallway continues to the south, while the tower entrance is back to     
the north.

A small circular room~
Here you are within the center of the very structure, the giant pillar caught     
your eye as you explored the palace.  The walls that surround you are extremely     
smooth to the touch, made of fine white marble. Warmth seems to emit from the     
very walls in invisible waves, wrapping around you, rendering you silent.  A     
throb of energy fills the room, making the walls look alive.  The noise grows     
louder and louder, echoing into your sensitized ears.  The throbbing suddenly     
lessens in intensity, leaving you with a sense of awe.  You think you see a     
tiny spiralling stairway tucked away to one side.

A short hallway~
The hallway looks similar to that of the downstairs halls, walls fuzzily waver     
between solidity and a cotton texture.  The decor of this portion of the exotic     
mansion is drab, nothing more than necessary, as it is mainly for the use of     
students and other regular visitors.  A few modest paintings make the walls seem     
a little less bare, and a rough and practical rug runs down the middle of the     
floor.  Large wooden doors flank the hallway to the east and west, and a door     
to a small storage closet can be seen to the south.

A large bedroom~
Brightly colored rugs made of woven canvas and cloth lay scattered upon the     
sturdy looking floor of the large sleeping quarters.  Magical lights send some     
colorful patterns against the relatively plain cloudy walls.  Numerous beds     
line the walls, covered in soft blankets filled with down, and fluffy pillows.     
Stacks of thickly bound books are piled near just about every bed, and a few     
are lined upon the sparse bookshelves along one wall.  Three or four desks have     
made their home in this room as well, beckoning you to sit down and study the     
art that is Magic.  The bedroom sprawls out to the east and south, and a large     
wooden door is set in the western wall.

A small closet filled with various cleaning agents and accessories occupies     
this space, tucked away between the two bedrooms.  The wooden door appears to     
be made of pine, and in taking a deep breathe you can still smell the sticky     
sap that made it's home there.  Brooms, soap, scrubbing brushes are all set     
neatly onto their shelves and stands.  There doesn't seem to be any apparent     
dust on any of the objects within, giving you the impression that the mages     
who live here keep their quarters tidy.

A crystalline tower~
The ground beneath your feet and the structure of the entire tower, looks to     
be made from solid ice.  The walls look to be made from blocks of the frosty     
stuff, yet they show no signs of melting despite the relative warmth of the     
air in here.  As you walk through the tower, you notice that the floor is not     
slippery as one might expect, but you are able to keep your steps firmly on     
the ground without a problem.  A few windows look out upon the surrounding sky     
and clouds, reminding you just how far up you really are.  You see more of the     
tower to the south and east.

The stairs here are once again made of the cloudlike substance that you found     
beneath your feet earlier.  In a manner that makes you uneasy, it seems to only     
solidify with every step you make upon this stairway.  The stairs themselves     
are rather narrow, as if made for those with much smaller feet than the average     
human.  Looking further up, you can see that the stairway itself is tight, not     
allowing for much movement other than following the stairs up.  You see the rest     
of the tower to the south and west, and the insubstantial stairway leads up and     
down.

Glowing spheres of multicolored light dance high within the towering painted     
ceilings of this vast library.  Books cover the walls from floor to ceiling,     
some newly printed out, some fragile and tattered.  Rugs lie scattered about     
the library, worn and threadbare from the constant patter of feet.  Tables,     
desks and chairs are positioned about the room, covered in scrolls, pens and     
other writing tools.  It would seem that this place is not only for research,     
but for restoration as well, as you see copied sheets of paper lying next to     
many of the older books on the tables.  The giant pillar stands quiet and     
looming in the center of the library.  You see the massive library to the east

A mural of action, grace, pain and joy overwhelm the ceiling in its entirety.     
Mage fights mage in a mess of blood and blasting flame, corpses of previous     
victims strewn at their feet, surrounding any chance of flight by physical     
means.  Elsewhere a woman kneels over in pain, dust falling from her hands,     
and tears from her eyes.  A large beast beside her, lion headed and winged,     
nuzzles her shoulder in a comforting manner.  In another painting up on the     
ceiling, a grey furred grimalkin dressed in livery holds a flag proudly in the     
air, and a purple robed man, dark of hair and bearded, opens his mouth in a     
wide grin.

E pillar~
The surface is smooth like marble, but when you put your hand to it, you know     
it isn't something natural.  It is cold to the touch, so much that it feels as     
though it is burning.  Some sort of unseen force seems to throb from this huge     
fixture, almost as if it breathes, lives.  The lights the room seem to throb     
with it, and you wonder at what strange power resides in this place.

doors are swung inward, their surface smooth with the exception of the vast     
decorative carvings made into them.  Books fill your vision from as far as you     
can see, and air smelling strongly of old papers and book bindings fills your     
nostrils.  A strong urge to grab a book and consume as much knowledge as you     
can overwhelms you, and it takes a moment to bring yourself back to reality.     
A fine, plush rug lays before the door, soothing the soles of your feet. You     
see the library branch off to the east and west, and a tower to the north.

A mural of action, grace, pain and joy overwhelm the ceiling in its entirety.     
Mage fights mage in a mess of blood and blasting flame, corpses of previous     
victims strewn at their feet, surrounding any chance of flight by physical     
means.  Elsewhere a woman kneels over in pain, dust falling from her hands,     
and tears from her eyes.  A large beast beside her, lion headed and winged,     
nuzzles her shoulder in a comforting manner.  In another painting up on the     
ceiling, a grey furred grimalkin dressed in livery holds a flag proudly in the     
air, and a purple robed man, dark of hair and bearded, opens his mouth in a     
wide grin.

The library~
Glowing spheres of multicolored light dance high within the towering painted     
ceilings of this vast library.  Books cover the walls from floor to ceiling,     
some newly printed out, some fragile and tattered.  Rugs lie scattered about     
the library, worn and threadbare from the constant patter of feet.  Tables,     
desks and chairs are positioned about the room, covered in scrolls, pens and     
other writing tools.  It would seem that this place is not only for research,     
but for restoration as well, as you see copied sheets of paper lying next to     
many of the older books on the tables.  The giant pillar stands quiet and     
looming in the center of the library.  A large door is set in the south wall,     
and the massive library continues to the east and west.

The surface is smooth like marble, but when you put your hand to it, you know

fixture, almost as if it breathes, lives.  The lights the room seem to throb     
with it, and you wonder at what strange power resides in this place.

very walls in invisible waves, wrapping around you, rendering you silent.  A     
throb of energy fills the room, making the walls look alive. The noise grows     
louder and louder, echoing into your sensitized ears.  The throbbing suddenly     
lessens in intensity, leaving you with a sense of awe.  You think you see a     
tiny spiralling stairway tucked away to one side.

means.  Elsewhere a woman kneels over in pain, dust falling from her hands,     
and tears from her eyes.  A large beast beside her, lion headed and winged,     
nuzzles her shoulder in a comforting manner.  In another painting up on the     
ceiling, a grey furred grimalkin dressed in livery holds a flag proudly in the     
air, and a purple robed man, dark of hair and bearded, opens his mouth in a     
wide grin.

E pillar~
The surface is smooth like marble, but when you put your hand to it, you know     
it isn't something natural.  It is cold to the touch, so much that it feels as     
though it is burning.  Some sort of unseen force seems to throb from this huge     
fixture, almost as if it breathes, lives.  The lights the room seem to throb     
with it, and you wonder at what strange power resides in this place.

The library~
Glowing spheres of multicolored light dance high within the towering painted     
ceilings of this vast library.  Books cover the walls from floor to ceiling,     
some newly printed out, some fragile and tattered.  Rugs lie scattered about     
the library, worn and threadbare from the constant patter of feet.  Tables,     
desks and chairs are positioned about the room, covered in scrolls, pens and     
other writing tools.  It would seem that this place is not only for research,     
but for restoration as well, as you see copied sheets of paper lying next to     
many of the older books on the tables.  The giant pillar stands quiet and     
looming in the center of the library.  The massive library sprawls out to the     
east and west, and a door is set in the north wall.

A spiraling stairway of clouds~
The cloudlike substance beneath your feet seems to solidify with every step     
you make upon this stairway.  The stairs themselves are rather narrow, as if     
made for those with much smaller feet than the average human.  The stairway     
itself is tight wound, not allowing for much movement other than following     
the stairs up or down.

The ivory tower observatory~
The top of this spired tower gives a splendid view over all of Shalar.  Clouds     
move slowly through the sky, and on a given night, the stars shine with clarity     
and brilliance.  A small desk used for note taking is here, as well as a cot.     
A few smaller spheres glow dimly near some torn papers tacked to the wall.
