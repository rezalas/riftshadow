A stray cat meanders here.    
~
This feline appears to be on the very brink of starvation.  Its fur is    
matted and coated with dust to the point that its original color can    
no longer be discerned.  Though the life it leads would seem to be    
disagreeable, you don't find yourself feeling sorrow for it... as it    
bares its teeth and hisses directly at you.

Larger than most cats, this fellow is obviously used to quite a bit of

it, rubbing and purring contentedly.  It's apparent he only wants a    
handout.

This dog seems to be looking for a cat to eat.

Almost wiry enough for a wolf, this dog prowls the streets of Dagdan     
snapping at everything he passes.  His fur is gray streaked with black    
and even has a few white spots.  He's obviously a mutt, and has likely    
lived the life of a wild animal.  Don't waste your time trying to    
domesticate him.

A vicious grin flashes across this fire giant's face when he sees you

weapons strapped to his back, and several other implements of war     
attached to his belt -- and yet he walks about barehanded, seeming to     
prefer hand-to-hand combat.

This tiny woman flits here and there around Dagdan, checking each shop    
for herbs and oils she can use in her chemistry experimentation.  Her    
garb is simple leather, and she seems unremarkable.  Except that her    
eyes are currently crackling with electricity.  Her hands appear to be    
stained permanently by herbs, and perhaps, by the passage of much    
arcane power through their mortal tissue.  She has obviously not    
focused her training on combat, as you see no weapons or trophies of    
any kind on her person, and yet you feel you can safely assume she    
would be able to defend herself rather adequately.

Dagdan is as much a sign of his being a thief and up to no good as

dagger every time someone approaches him.  His clothing is light, and    
moves very freely so as not to make so much as a whisper as he moves.

appear to be covered with small scars, all long healed over.  His    
leather and fur clothing has been finely stitched together with    
catgut twine, and a belt over his shoulder contains pouches filled    
with strong-smelling herbs.

One of many in Dagdan who seem to be in the employ of the assassin    
guild, this man's charisma is incapacitating.  It's very likely he's    
used his unassuming appearance and charming personality to get close    
to quite a few of his targets.  You can only discern his occupation    
by his proximity to so many others who are less secretive about their    
place in life.  Apparently this man isn't interested in stealth while    
in Dagdan.

slips around the town with an excess of sneakiness.  The sheer volume    
of caution and readiness his demeanor exudes is the very thing that    
makes his occupation readily apparent.  He probably won't want to    
make conversation.

A weary traveler walks the street, looking for an Inn.

A storm giant woman plods heavily across the cobblestones of Dagdan,    
tired from a long journey.  She began within the Aryth Ocean, and now    
travels to the oceans beyond the forest to the north to visit others    
of her kind.  Perhaps because she is female, she is smaller than most     
storm giants, and can ride a mount.  A HUGE mount.  Her clothing    
appears to have been woven from kelp, and she has dozens of water    
skins, insulated canteens, and jugs full of her favorite liquid    
about her person... on a necklace, attached to her belt, and filling    
her pack.  This woman loves water.

and you assume this pitiful wretch to have been driven insane by pain.    
"The third... I was..." he trails off and falls into a fitful sleep.

Baram Evir~
The mayor of Dagdan stands here smiling and greeting those who pass.    
~
Baram Evir, the mayor of Dagdan, shakes your hand as you pass.  He is    
richly clothed, as you might expect.  The crest of Dagdan (though it    
seems rather presumptuous for such a poor frontier town to have a    
crest, let alone a mayor) is emblazoned upon his bright tunic.      
Suddenly, he speaks in a deep and thickly accented voice:    
    
"As with any frontier settlement, we've experienced our share of     
outlaw activity," he explains in a well-rehearsed speech.  "However,     
as mayor, I've taken certain steps to assure that nothing like that     
will rear its ugly head here again.  While in the town, you'll     
doubtless see the criminal element being escorted beyond our city     
limits."  Baram winks, points to a grumbling thief nearby, and moves     
on to deliver the same speech to the next traveler coming into Dagdan.

behind his neck to scratch himself, where a canvas collar seems to be

delicately and intricately as any elf upon his percussive instrument.    
The patterns he beats remind you of war, then of the sound of a horse    
galloping across an open plain, and then of the monotony of sea     
travel.  There seems to be no end to this man's rhythmic vocabulary.

sea captain sailor man seafaring~
a sea captain~
A seafaring man is here, drowning his sorrow.    
~
This man's tale of woe begins with a single beer, and ends with a very    
large drink.  "THE drink," in fact--the ocean.  It seems he had a bit    
too much grog in Arkham the morning his ship was to depart for New    
Thalos by way of the Dragon Sea, and he navigated her directly onto    
the rocks below the Cliffs of Insanity.  His beached ship was    
abandoned, and shortly picked apart by scavenging pirates.  The only    
bright point he can make is that his cargo was already in Arkham--and    
he was returning to New Thalos for another load.  Stone, for building,    
carved directly out of the Tahril mountains.  If he had been carrying    
such a load at the time of his accident, his boat would have drawn a    
much deeper trail through the sea, and would have beached much farther    
out on the water.  His men would have drowned trying to reach shore,    
or worse, been killed by raiding pirates.  Between hiccups and burps,    
the captain relates this tale of what he considers to be "an unlucky    
sort of luck," and then fades into a comatose state on the bar.

as well.  He seems salty and bitter, yet somehow approachable, should    
you need to talk.  He purchased this inn with money he earned on his    
own, and he keeps it up with the constant business Dagdan's location    
provides.  His vest is smudged with various food products and stained    
with every variety of drink, and his black hair is a tangled mess atop    
his square head.  If he were any less friendly, you could picture him    
as a fearsome street fighter rather easily.

Bela looks up at you when you enter, and chuckles--an irritating,    
high-pitched sound.  He pulls his hands away from the pig he's gutting    
and reaches to shake one of yours.  As you recoil away from the blood     
and intestine covering his glove, he chuckles again--you wish he'd     
stop--and reaches for a towel to clean himself off.  Aside from a    
tough white canvas apron, you can't tell what this man is wearing.    
Not much is visible around the apron, and what is visible is covered    
in more gore.  This man is not a careful butcher, and you shudder    
at the prospect of watching him work.

a svirf peddler~
A svirf peddler shows his wares on the street.    
~
This deep gnome has skin of a pale white hue, and black eyes that    
stand out like a sail against a dark stormy sea.  He moves quietly,    
and speaks little while doing business.  He seems to be locked to    
this spot on the street, as though years of testing have shown that    
the amount of traffic there is better than elsewhere on the road.    
When you examine his wares, an evil grin silently spreads across    
the svirfnebli's face, and he winks evilly, nudging your arm.

Danellanor~
A kindly elven gentleman stands here.    
~
This jade-skinned elf immediately strikes you as an honest man.  His    
shop surrounds both of you with foreign pleasing smells and exotic     
colors and shapes, and a warm breeze squeezes its way between all the    
plants and leaves to brush across your face and add to your level of    
comfort.  This shop, the senses, and the shop's keeper all make you    
feel that you've come home.  He exhibits the few food products he can    
muster in Dagdan's hard soil with pride, and then shows you his     
favorite items--the foliage from the Vale of Arendyl.  Herbs and     
leaves, extracts and stems, whole plants potted in rich mountain soil.    
Danellanor has found uses for uniquely elven plants which no other    
botanist has yet conceived.

Pzandra~
Pzandra, the duergar blacksmith, is here.

Her beard would put Jullias himself to shame.  Her hairy chin waggles     
as Pzandra gossips with other women in this shop, and her thick, oily     
black beard juts directly out like a pike, waggling up and down with    
it.  Pzandra seems remarkably friendly for a duergar... until one of    
the Dagdan gossips mentions her neighbor Tarni.  Her eyes turn to pure    
iron, and she stiffens suddenly.  A few acidic barbs are spat, and she    
turns coldly to her forge to continue with the work she's been     
avoiding.  The other women scatter from the shop, fleeing in terror    
from this duergar woman's temper.

Tarni~
Tarni, the dwarven mithril smith, is here.    
~
Tarni is hard at work on a large, flat piece of mithril.  What it is     
destined to become isn't apparent yet, but the red hot slab of metal    
is quickly taking shape and form, and with that, function and purpose.    
She looks up and sees you entering, greets you warmly, and warns you     
to avoid the puddle at the door (just in time).  As you gaze     
around her shop, you hear someone screaming next door.  You turn your    
face toward Tarni, with an expression of confusion, and she sighs    
apologetically.  "Pzandra, an intensely emotional duergar," she     
laughs.  "We have a healthy business relationship."  Tarni scratches    
her beard, sniffs and shrugs, then goes back to work.

An interesting article of clothing indeed, this belt is thick and     
wide, protecting quite a bit of a warrior's midsection.  It is tapered    
in front and back to allow better range of movement, but bolstered on    
each side to prevent wrenching the lower part of the spine in odd    
directions.  It has half a dozen pockets and pouches trailing around    
its outer face, and each of these holds something which is used to    
inflict pain in a brawl.  Brass knuckles, iron spikes, a small sack     
filled with a few lumps of lead...  On the inner face of this belt,    
a long series of strange symbols is etched.

film covering them, as though they've been sitting for a very, very     
long time.  They even emit a slight phosphorescent glow in the dark.

This is a wide dirt path made from moist, healthy soil.  It leads from    
west to east, and is wide enough for ten men to walk abreast.  To the     
south, the plains reach as far as the eye can see with no break save    
for the West Dairein Road off to the east.  To the north, the dazzling    
forest you've been gawking at is clear through the mist which seems    
to envelop it.  The sound of strange birdcalls is audible, and you've    
not heard their like anywhere else in the world...  To the northwest,

Here, the road to Dagdan bends from north to east and from east to     
north.  This area is covered with cobblestones, and as you look to    
the north, they continue on toward a cluster of buildings to that    
direction -- presumably Dagdan itself.  The street ends here, and    
to the south and west stretch endless plains.  Off in the east, you    
see West Dairein Road, and beyond the city to the north is a vast    
forest, nearly covering the horizon in that direction.  There's a    
very strange warbling sound in the air all around you...

The Gate to the Great Northwest~
On the very outskirts of Dagdan, you encounter a huge sign painted     
in mostly gold and silver which reads:    
    
"Welcome to Dagdan, the Gate to the Great Northwest."    
    
Just down the street to the north, the tiny town of Dagdan sits,     
nearly devoured by the Giant Forest beyond it.  The town is close     
enough that you can make out every detail, and yet it is this forest    
which dominates your field of view.  It towers above the town and     
looms like a titanic predatory animal ready to descend and crush the    
infinite plains to your south.  You are still well beyond its reach,    
and yet it seems to curve through the air above you and soar so far    
into the air directly above you, that you stumble backwards glimpsing    
the tops of these impossibly tall trees.

Dagdan's South Gate~
This collection of shops and streets forms a quaint little town, and     
its setting is one of the most dramatic in Thera -- right on the brink     
of the Giant Forest.  Those trees stand like sentinels over this tiny     
settlement, and the trade done here all takes place within their     
shadow.  If a traveler has just arrived, he's either come from the     
forest to the north or the plains to the south, and in need of     
significant rest.  If he's leaving, he's on his way to one of those,     
and this tradepost of a city exists to provide him with supplies for    
the long journey ahead.

This is Baram Evir's private dwelling, inhabited usually only during

seeing to the enforcement of his anti-outlaw plan.  Nearly everything    
in this room is of the highest quality, constructed of the most     
expensive materials imaginable.  Trade, and the constant flow of     
business in travelers coming through, has obviously been good to     
Dagdan and it's mayor.  The room consists of a desk in the center     
with a large chair behind it.  Several bookshelves line each wall,     
and a small bed is in the northwest corner next to a fireplace.

breastplates, shining in the sun which filters through the shop's     
straw roof.  Against the opposite wall, helmets and gauntlets,     
leggings and sleeves are all lovingly mounted and displayed.  As you

and shape, and in eventual purpose.  Tools of all sorts for     
manipulating the glowing heated mithril the forge produces daily are    
hanging on the wall.  To the south, a door leads back into the main

The ground here is slick, like rocks on the shore of a stagnant     
body of water.  A musty, damp smell that is altogether unpleasant    
drifts through here, and you nearly gag as this odor assaults your    
senses.  The darkness is nearly overwhelming, and the only light you    
can see is being reflected from the street by the slimy surface of the     
cobblestones.  The alley ends abruptly here, and you don't doubt that    
if you couldn't see by your own means, you would have met the wall to    
the west rather bodily.

The Entrance to the Assassins' Guild~
The darkness continues here, and the sounds of dripping water are the     
only ones audible.  Peering to the east, you can barely distinguish a    
few dark forms slipping back and forth.  To the west, the dark     
alleyway.  A musty smell hangs in the air, and you feel as though     
there is movement all around.

The Dark Spot~
Dark as the Devil's back pocket, this spot is rumored to be the place    
where the most hated assassins, mercenaries, and bounty hunters     
in the world congregate to compare winnings and to plot with and     
against one another.  More schemes have been hatched here than     
anywhere else.  The wall is lined with the sharp and exotic implements    
of silent warfare.  In fact, the entire room seems to be bristling     
with venomous blades... and yet, no one seems to worry.  The assassins    
whispering their quiet way across the floor like ghosts pay no     
attention to the blades, simply gracefully slipping from place to     
place around and between the piles and stacks of deadly metals.

The Southern Commons~
This is the southern end of a huge hall, the main room of Norman's     
Inn.  Mounted on the wall is a large friendly sign.  Norman's     
customers mill around like ants here, conversing with gratuitous     
volume and examining the items they've purchased today in Dagdan's    
many shops and markets.  Hanging from the ceiling, you see a large     
wagon wheel studded with magical orbs of continually glowing light,    
illuminating the room at all times of the day.  It appears that this    
wheel can be turned, obscuring as many of the orbs as seems necessary    
behind a wooden panel in order to dim the room's lighting.  A     
fireplace crackles merrily at one end of the room, and paintings line     
every possible vertical surface.

E fireplace~
Made of grey and red stones mortared together with a black material,    
this fireplace provides tremendous heat to the room.  Along the wall,    
you see a system of long, perfectly constructed mithril piping (likely     
provided by the town's mithril smith).  This fireplace must generate     
heat for the entire inn.    
~
E paintings~
Along the walls in this room are paintings of various events and     
people.  One large one of the mayor of Dagdan hangs right over the    
fireplace, and another, a landscape portrait of the Giant Forest,    
is over the entrance to the Inn.  Most of the rest of the portraits    
and paintings are unfamiliar to you.  Some of them include depictions     
of a large battle in what appears to be New Thalos, a small greyish     
man, and a large face divided down its center.

Norman's Bar~
A bar larger than any you've seen graces the northwest area of this     
room, obviously the centerpiece of this entire floor.  Fully thirty     
feet long, its expansive surface seats as many as fifteen men or six    
giants.  Behind, Norman stalks back and forth grinning evilly and     
swapping evil jokes, and a cabinet -- also thirty feet long -- holds    
the most amazing amount of liquor you've ever seen collected.  Loud    
men drink and shout, and women scurry back and forth to serve those     
patrons who have seated themselves in the common room.  Judging by    
the food they carry, there must be a grill behind the bar as well, but    
it is entirely obscured by either the drunkards, the immense liquor    
cabinet, or Norman himself.

The Inn's Stairwell~
A large wooden staircase leads up to the second level of Norman's Inn.    
The entire Inn is made of beautiful timberframe construction, and     
these stairs are an amazing example of that.  Reddish wood from the     
Giant Forest to the north tightly panels the walls and the high     
ceiling, and makes up the stairs and railings.  Support struts,     
seemingly more for decoration than any structural purpose, add to the     
strange beauty of this simple spiral stairwell.  The red wood has a    
wonderful, sweet smell to it, and this smell permeates the whole Inn.

The Inn's Storage Room~
This area of the Inn seems to be where Norman stores his extra beer     
and other supplies.  A stack of chairs here, a pile of mugs there,     
this room is a large jumble of the makings of an inn and could likely    
furnish an entire separate inn, should Norman someday be inclined to    
expand his operation.  There are no windows in this room, and the red    
wooden walls smell like the Giant Forest.  Thera's largest beer keg     
stands against the southern wall.

Thera if it had to.  Made of the same red wood as the rest of this     
inn, it stands at least twenty feet tall and its top scratches the    
high ceiling.  You doubt Norman ever has a need to move it.  Working    
your way around the edge of this virtual man-made ocean of beer, you    
can make out a door on the far side, on the south wall of the room.

A Grassy Trail~
Outside the city, this grassy trail leads through the serene outskirts     
of Dagdan between Norman's Inn and the road outside town.  South

the horizon.  To the north, Norman's Inn beckons.  No fence stands     
between you and the plains to the south and east -- simply the     
buildings of Dagdan and a few trees on one side, endless plains on the     
other.  Staring out at the plains, it's easy to feel very small and

Pzandra's items aren't worth real money.  The noise in this shop is    
loud and obnoxious, but it isn't what you might expect -- the sound    
of metal striking metal is mysteriously absent.  Instead, shrill     
voices chatter and gossip late into the night every day...

spotted with the dried, dark red substance.  Despite the horrible    
conditions, the cuts of meat seem well carved, and have been wrapped    
to prevent flies from getting to them.  Enthusiasm is to be lauded,    
at least...

Plants and pots, dirt and water... these are the themes of this small

which have no name in your mind.  There are scents you've never     
imagined breezing about, riding through the store on a forest wind     
from the north.  Leaves and vines flutter in this breeze, and flower    
petals ride through the air along with the damp air.  This shop truly    
does remind you of a miniature version of the beautiful Vale of

Tree Road branches off in three directions.

The ground here is slick, like rocks on the shore of a stagnant     
body of water.  A musty, damp smell that is altogether unpleasant    
drifts through here, and you nearly gag as this odor assaults your    
senses.  The darkness is nearly overwhelming, and the only light you    
can see is being reflected from the street by the slimy surface of the     
cobblestones.

The End of the Road~
Staring toward the forest from here, you receive a sensation of     
hurtling from the civilized world directly into the jaws of nature...    
The trees may appear giant from the town to the south, but from this     
vantage point, their monolithic size is disquieting.  All around you,    
tree trunks the size of houses fire angrily upward from the soil at a     
dizzying rate to slash the very surface of the celestial hemisphere     
above.  If you keep your eyes to the ground, perhaps you will avoid    
the overwhelming feeling of disorientation that comes with this     
forest.  North, you can easily make out a clearing between several    
massive trunks.  To the south, the tiny town of Dagdan breaks its    
way free of the Giant Forest's clutches.

A Tiny Clearing~
A bed of grass and the fine mulch of rotted leaves makes for very     
comfortable footing here.  Any intake of breath nearly overwhelms you,     
the amazingly sweet scent of the wood of this forest is pungent enough     
to pierce any haze you may be experiencing mentally, and then create a     
whole new one for you.  The light which filters down this far through     
the tree cover above you is a deep green color, casting an eerie glow     
upon all of your surroundings.  To the north, the Giant Forest dives     
down the steep sides of a huge valley that's impossible to see from     
outside the woods south of here...  You can actually peer between the     
massive trunks to the immediate north, and above the treetops far off     
in the distance.  The view from here, provided that you can find a     
line of sight through the trees, is amazing.  A vast mountain range     
strikes its way through the clouds in the northeast, and to the     
northwest, this forest continues beyond the opposite edge of the deep     
valley which neutralizes its towering height, and on to the horizon.

The Giant Forest~
The edge of a monstrous valley, this part of the forest is on a fairly    
steep incline.  The trail you are on leads north into the valley and     
south out of it.  The leaf cover far above you almost entirely snuffs     
out any light which might attempt to pierce it.  The forest around you     
is not dark by any means, but its lighting is twilight-like at best,     
perpetually.  An odd warbling sound fills the forest -- the call of     
the wild turkey, an odd looking species of bird which is one of many     
that are unique to this part of the continent.  To your north, the     
valley continues toward what appears to be the edge of the world (but     
what is likely simply the other side of this titanic valley).  South,     
you can climb up to the edge of this side.

Tree Road simply comes to an end here... you can see directly out the     
end of Dagdan, along the edge of the Giant Forest and into the plains

impression of a comfortable little village that the rest of Dagdan     
exudes, and make it feel more like an uncivilized frontier town.      
This is likely one place where the Mayor plans to expand and continue     
to build.

In the Rafters~
The reason you climbed up here is a fact you've forgotten, and in its

of this warehouse is extremely hot -- the prairie sun beats down on it     
all day long, and the heat inside the rest of the warehouse all rises     
to here.  Beyond the uncomfortable warmth, the only way to move around     
is by edging along the rafters in any given direction.  The fact that     
it's very dark up here doesn't help matters in that respect any,     
either.  The sweet scent of the wood everything in Dagdan is     
constructed with is baked by the sweltering heat, and its intensity is     
nearly sickening up here.

place is a great deal of concern for your well-being.  The upper level     
of this warehouse is extremely hot -- the prairie sun beats down on it     
all day long, and the heat inside the rest of the warehouse all rises     
to here.  Beyond the uncomfortable warmth, the only way to move around     
is by edging along the rafters in any given direction.  The fact that     
it's very dark up here doesn't help matters in that respect any,     
either.  The sweet scent of the wood everything in Dagdan is     
constructed with is baked by the sweltering heat, and its intensity is     
nearly sickening up here.

Through the Hole~
It's quite a lot cooler on this side of the wall than inside the     
warehouse.  In fact, this small tunnel-like structure doesn't even     
appear to be indoors... rather, roughly built upon the roof of a     
building next to the warehouse, as though it were an afterthought     
and not a part of the original design.  To the south, a few faint     
whispers can be heard in the cool darkness.  To the west, you can     
crawl through a hole and into the rafters of the warehouse next door.

Entrance to the Thieves' Guild~
This part of the impromptu tunnel widens somewhat, and a few quiet men    
have gathered here to whisper.  Grey cloth is draped across the wooden     
framework of the tunnel, in order to make it "lightproof."  The system    
seems to work, as this area is pitch black.  To the south, a tiny     
light source flickers gently off the walls, while to the north, utter    
blackness consumes the tunnel once again.  The air is cool, and flows    
gently back and forth as though it were just another whisperer in the     
dark.

The Hidden Room~
A tiny candle flickers from the center of a small table here,     
illuminating what appears to be a friendly card game.  The men in this     
room are all experienced thieves, and the card players intently watch     
each other's hands to insure that no unauthorized thievery breaks out.      
    
It is here that some of the finest thieves in this region of Thera are     
trained.  A few dummies with pockets of varying size have been stuffed     
into a corner to collect dust -- this guild's master believes in     
practice in the field.

Behind the Wall~
This appears to be a very tight hallway which was actually built into     
the structure, simply by placing a second wall at this edge of the     
building.  West, the boards have been carelessly placed and allow     
passage into a warehouse, while the hallway itself moves south.  The     
floor here is littered with papers and bottles, as though it receives     
quite a bit of traffic and no sanitary visitations.

A Private Room~
Norman has spared no expense in furnishing these private rooms for     
paying customers.  An evening's respite, a good night's sleep, and a     
place to reflect upon the long journey behind you (or ahead of you)     
are all provided perfectly by this comfortable room.  Glass statuettes     
and pewter figurines decorate shelves along the walls, and the entire     
place is the same orangish-reddish hue as the rest of the inn, made of     
that same red wood from the Giant Forest.  Here, though, the wood has     
been aged somewhat, and the sometimes sickeningly sweet smell is     
slightly less intrusive.  A bed and a cabinet furnish one side of the     
room (both made of red wood), and a small linen closet stands open at     
the other side, ready for your belongings should you wish to stay and     
sleep.
