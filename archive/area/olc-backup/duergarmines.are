vesur gnome~
Vesur~
A balding gnome dressed in plain gray robes stands here.    
~
This small, gray robed figure stands perhaps three and a half feet in height.    
His robes appear well made, though far from extravagant, with a subtle silver    
wave embroidered down the cowling and sides.  His hood is thrown back around    
his shoulders, revealing a very bald scalp and a piercing green eyes in a    
pale, age-lined face.  On a thin silver chain around his neck hangs the    
traditional scales of justice, the symbol of lawmen from all across Thera.  A    
retired Arbiter, Vesur, once known as the Sage of the Western Plains, spends    
his elder years exploring the face of Thera with near as much vigor as in his    
youth, though without the duties of an Arbiter to restrict his curiosity.  He    
crosses his arms over his chest and turns his hard gaze to the surrounding    
caves.

brimon felar~
Brimon~
A dark-furred felar leans heavily on a staff as he limps through here.    
~
This proud looking felar limps cautiously through the caves, with the aid of    
a thin wooden staff which he clutches in one paw-like hand.  His fur was once    
a rich brown color, but has largely gone to gray in his advanced years.  His    
robes are of plain coarse wool, though you notice a spot of red embroidery    
over his left breast in the shape of the Fasces, the symbol of the Arbiters    
of Law.  His long career as a lawman ended many years ago during a mishap with    
the Empire, after which he entered retirement, occasionally following his    
gnomish companion on one escapade or another.  Despite his obvious age,    
Brimon's cat-like eyes survey the caves alertly, and he holds his staff with    
the skill that only one who has spent a lifetime studying such a weapon can    
attain.  You also notice several small bandages on his arms and chest, and you    
think you hear him mutter something about porcupines under his breath.

the spirit of Trel'aran~
A huge clouded form solidifies into the shape of an ancient dragon.    
~
A shapeless cloud hovers before you, fingers of mist streaming off into the air    
as it swirls around itself.  As you watch the mist begins to solidify, slowly    
taking the shape of a translucent dragon.  The huge beast turns its head in    
your direction, as it moves you realize that you can see the stone walls behind    
it through its swirling skin.  A wave of evil and terror washes over you as,    
for a heartbeat, the spirit dragon becomes completely corporeal, revealing    
gleaming, solid black scales and a maw filled with flawless ivory teeth, large    
enough to swallow most giants whole.  It turns its gaze upon you, showing two    
empty sockets where its eyes once were.  The beast throws its head back in a    
silent roar, before fading back into an insubstantial misty cloud.

A stocky duergar walks through here with a miner's pickaxe over his shoulder.    
~
This duergar looks typical of his race, no more than four and a half feet in    
height, and nearly as wide.  A long bushy beard dominates his face, which    
appears to be poorly kept judging by its frayed appearance.  A studded mithril    
vest covers his muscular torso, and a dented mithril hard hat provides some    
head A 'protection' none, standard issue for the miners.  He mutters quietly to    
himself as he swings a heavy pickaxe up over one shoulder and wanders off down    
the cave.

A cloud of rock dust rises into the air around this duergar as he loads large    
blocks of raw mithril into an ore cart.  He is dressed in the standard-issue    
miners gear, consisting of a studded mithril vest and a dented hard hat along    
with a heavy pickaxe resting in a loop on his belt.  He runs his stubby, filthy    
fingers through his equally filthy beard, and reaches for another block of    
mithril.

~
A shower of small stones and dust fill the air as this duergar miner swings his    
pickaxe mightily, chipping through the rock as he works around a vein of    
mithril.  As the dust settles slightly you notice his miners garb, a studded    
mithril vest and a dented mithril hard hat.  The duergar pauses to wipe his    
filthy sleeve over his forehead, then grunts loudly and swings his pickaxe    
back behind his head.

a duergar miner~
A burly duergar dressed in miners garb pauses his work to glance at you.    
~
This duergar is unusually short for his kind, appearing to stand no more than    
four feet or so in height.  His width, however, far more than makes up for any    
lack of mass.  You estimate this miner outweighs most of his companions by    
half again as much.  His studded mithril vest strains mightily over his chest,    
barely managing to cover him at all.  His dented hard hat is tilted backwards,    
revealing a bald head streaked with sweat and dirt.  He rests his pickaxe    
against the wall and coughs loudly, before glancing in your direction.

An armored duergar stands here, absently stroking his beard.    
~
This slightly over-weight duergar is dressed in heavy mithril armor, leaving    
very little of his skin visible.  Much of his armor appears worn and dented,    
as if its owner had been through heavy fighting.  A pair of matching adamantite    
hammers hang from loops on his belt, which strikes you as odd since the    
majority of the duergar seem to favor mithril weapons.  He stifles a yawn as    
he glances about the caves, and absently strokes his heavy beard.

~
A muscular duergar paces the length of the cave, peering into the darkness    
intently.  He casually spins a mithril short sword as he walks, handling it with    
obvious skill.  The duergar is covered in a suit of mithril plate armor, though    
you can not tell for certain if the mithril is a darkened tint itself, or if    
the duergar is just really dirty, which is a definite possibility in the mines.

the duergar lieutenant~
A guard lieutenant stands here with his arms crossed, muttering under his    
breath.    
~
This older duergar is obviously in charge of the other duergar in the mines, as    
he shouts out brisk orders in between mutterings.  His beard is streaked with    
gray, and his dark face is beginning to show some wrinkles of age.  The    
lieutenant's armor is of higher quality than the other guards, with ornate    
engraving along the edges and across his chest.  Like many of the duergar, he    
seems to favor the axe as his weapon of choice.  His, however, does not appear    
to be the standard short-hafted mithril weapon that predominates the other    
guards.  Instead, sheathed in a baldric on his back is a pitch-black axe lined    
with gleaming silver engravings in an unfamiliar language.  He crosses his    
arms as he glances down the tunnels, and resumes muttering to himself.

Standing roughly four feet in height, this burly dwarf likely outweighs anyone    
half again as tall.  He grips a huge two-headed hammer in both hands and    
swings it up in front of him, pulling out a dirty cloth to wipe the remnants    
of duergar brains off.  He wears a suit of heavy, slightly-worn dwarven    
platemail emblazoned with the mark of Mortorn on the chest.  Around his neck    
hangs a small amulet in the shape of an axe and a hammer crossed over a shield.

A tall dwarf stands here, peering out into the darkness eagerly.  He appears    
extremely thin for a dwarf, with little sign of the burly chest and broad    
shoulders typical of most of dwarven kind.  Unlike the others, this dwarf wears    
a suit of light chainmail as opposed to the heavy plate armor.  Around his neck    
hangs a small amulet in the shape of an axe and a hammer crossed over a shield.    
A pair of short swords rest lightly in his hands as he pauses to glance at the    
other dwarves.

the dwarven berserker~
A filthy dwarf in spiked armor twitches violently, a wild look in his eyes.    
~
A big ball of hair and spikes paces through the room, never coming close to    
sitting still for even a second.  A huge beard nearly covers this dwarf's     
entire face, aside from two wide, blood-shot eyes that never seem to come to    
rest on any one thing for more than a second or two.  His armor is a ragged     
assortment of iron and mithril, with spikes protruding in every direction.      
Many of the spikes look to have been added to an existing piece of spike-less    
armor with nails, among other things.  In contrast to the rest of his attire,    
you notice a small amulet around his neck in the shape of an axe and a hammer    
crossed over a shield.  The berserker takes a deep swallow from a dented     
silver flask, then belches loudly and continues twitching.

An old dwarf dressed in heavy robes surveys the caves carefully.

A large barrel of a dwarf stands here, examining his surroundings carefully.    
Unlike the other dwarves he is dressed in heavy robes, though when he moves you    
hear the rustle of chainmail beneath.  His robes are held by a simple sash tied    
around his waist, and a baldric on his back.  In one hand he holds a heavy axe    
which he rests over his shoulder.  A glowing amulet hangs around his neck,    
similar to the plain one seen on the dwarves with him.  The dwarf wraps one    
hand around the amulet as if drawing strength from it, then turns around and    
bellows an order to the dwarves following him and gestures towards the tunnels.

no pickaxe, though you can not determine what other job he might have down in

grabbing a moment of rest before the duergar guards force him back to work.

growth of facial hair.  He appears large even for one of his kind, and in    
between swings of his pickaxe, you notice him eyeing his captors carefully.  As    
he turns his head you catch sight of a tattoo on his cheek marking him as a    
ranger from the Vale of Arendyl.  The half-elf pauses to wipe sweat off his

seems to vanish into the darkness in a heartbeat, and you suddenly hear a     
vicious growl from behind you.

This dark-elf appears to have been wounded in some sort of battle, though    
oddly enough, he also appears half drowned, as his white hair hangs about

His once fine chainmail is shredded off his left shoulder, and his left    
arm dangles limply.  In his right he clutches the hilt of a broken off    
longsword, although upon closer inspection, the blade appears to have been    
pitted and melted off with acid, rather than broken.  The dark-elf squeezes    
his eyes together tightly, as if fighting off unconciousness as he leans     
heavily against the stone wall.

curve along its length.  The sword appears to be designed only for two-    
handed use judging by its extremely long hilt, which allows the wielder to    
space his or her hands far apart for excellent control of the blade.  The     
hilt itself is solid silver and gold, forged in the shape of a silver-winged    
phoenix, its wings spread wide forming the cross braces and its gaping maw     
flowing gracefully into the blade.  The light gleams brilliantly off the     
unmarred, highly-polished surface as you turn the sword in your hands, and

E journal notebook book~
There are pages upon pages of hand-written notes in this little journal,    
many obviously written in a form of shorthand, rending them nearly    
impossible to read by any besides the author.  One of the pages, marked    
with a small red tassel, appears to have been written in a different hand,    
weather by another person, or just more carefully by the same person, you    
can not tell.  The part that catches your attention reads:    
    
  You'll know it by the inscription on the blade in ancient    
  arial.  Its an extremely tedious language to translate,    
  but its hard to mistake identifying it.  The only thing    
  I've been able to figure out for certain is that they    
  refer to the phoenix as the 'fire-spirit', which is a    
  literal translation from the word 'Tara'rroga'.      
    
Notations have been scribbled in the margins in several places, all in    
the hand of the first writer.  You can read a few of them:      
     
  'Bal' appears to be the word for 'Light' as it refers to    
  goodness and such.  Og'o'an = blood?  'Tora' seems to     
  mean 'Lord'... although I can not discern if it refers    
  to a specific lord or person, or just as a generic     
  position or honorary.  The whole thing appears to     
  translate as some sort of war cry, I think.    
    
The rest of it is either illegible, or completely unrelated.  No where    
can you find the phrase the writer seems to be trying to translate.

This longsword was obviously of extremely fine craftsmanship, and judging    
by the markings on the hilt, of dark-elven make.  The blade, however, has    
been broken off an inch or so above the cross brace.  As you inspect it    
closely, it looks to have actually been melted off with acid, as the    
remaining portion is pitted and melted.

Below the mine shaft~
This portion of the cave appears to have once been a dead end of solid    
stone, now it is dominated by a large contraption of gears and pulleys that    
make up the lift.  A huge counterweight hangs from a large length of chain    
which leads up to the city above, where it is operated by one of the duergar    
miners.  As you look up the darkness of the shaft, you catch a brief glimpse    
of movement around the edges of the lift.  A rusted iron plaque has been    
bolted to the far wall.

The mining tunnels~
It is hard to tell if these tunnels began as natural formations or were     
created by mortal hands, but it is clear they have been extensively mined    
since.  The ground has been worn smooth and cleared of debris, while the walls    
and ceiling are roughly cut, though definitely square in shape.  Crude iron    
frames have been erected to help support the ceiling at even intervals along    
the cave.  Rusted iron tracks run the length of the tunnels, forming a Y here,    
leading to the east, west and south.

The tracks and ceiling supports in these caves are constructed of very low-    
quality iron, much of it heavily rusted and pitted.  It would appear the    
duergar only use the pure mithril to construct more valuable items, rather    
than wasting it on things like these.  The tracks are spaced several feet    
apart, designed for an ore cart to travel down, while the ceiling supports    
appear sturdy enough to at least, you hope, hold the caves together.

The mining tunnels~
The roughly carved tunnel comes to an abrupt end as you round the corner.    
From the marks on the stone in front of you, it appears as though this tunnel    
is in the process of being extended, as veins of mithril and other precious    
metals lead the miners further into the bowels of Thera.  An iron support has    
been partially erected here, and supplies lie against one wall, apparently for    
the continuation of the tracks to allow the ore carts can reach the newer    
mining areas.

The mining tunnels~
It is hard to tell if these tunnels began as natural formations or were     
created by mortal hands, but it is clear they have been extensively mined    
since.  The ground has been worn smooth and cleared of debris, while the walls    
and ceiling are roughly cut, though definitely square in shape.  Crude iron    
frames have been erected to help support the ceiling at even intervals along    
the cave.  Rusted iron tracks run the length of the tunnels, extending to the    
west and south.

The mining tunnels~
This part of the tunnel appears to have started as a mining project, judging    
by the iron ceiling supports and the beginning of tracks for the ore carts    
running along the floor.  Work here seems to have been interrupted however, as    
the far wall is a mass of collapsed rubble and loose rocks.  A few tools lie    
scattered about, seemingly abandoned by their users.  A closer inspection of    
the far wall shows signs that the tunnel continued through here at one point,    
though the cave-in has completely blocked any passage now.

An assortment of worn pickaxes, chisels, and hammers lie scattered about,

to the cave-in up ahead.

The tunnel appears to have continued to the north at one point, but a

boulders block the way, while masses of smaller rubble and debris assure    
that no one will be able to slip through anywhere.

Leaving the mining tunnels~
As you pass beneath the last of the iron ceiling supports erected by the    
duergar, the sounds of their mining begins to fade to faint, rhythmic echoes.    
The jagged walls begin to narrow, and the footing becomes precarious as you    
enter the solid blackness of the deep, untamed tunnels.  A slight chill seems    
to pass through you, as the realization sets in that you have passed beyond the    
duergar territory, and into the Underdark.

The tunnel seems to narrow here, and you're almost certain this section has    
an upward slope to it.  While the stones almost completely block the way,    
you think you can slip through an opening to the west.

The entire cavern is filled with a heavy gray mist, originating from a huge    
waterfall somewhere to the east which you can hear clearly as a thunderous    
roaring sound.  A faint greenish light fills the room, apparently due to a    
slick fungus that grows over every single surface of rock near you.  The stones    
beneath your feet are slick from the fungus and the settling fog, leaving your    
footing precarious.  You shiver slightly as the wetness sets into your clothing

In an underground lake~
You find yourself completely disoriented as you dive below the surface of the    
underground lake.  You are surrounded completely in clouded water, beaten to a    
froth by the nearby waterfall, leaving you unable to see even your hand in front    
of your face.  You just hope you can tell which direction is up.

Behind the waterfall~
The water washes up against a small stone ledge behind and somewhat below the    
waterfall.  A tremendous roaring sound fills this small cavern, as the noise of    
the huge waterfall echoes through the stones.  The walls, ceiling and floor all    
glow a faint green from some sort of fungus that seems to thrive in the dark,    
wet environment.  As you take a step, however, you realize that the fungus    
makes everything extremely slick.  Walking carefully, you can head down the    
cave to the east, or back into the water to the west.

perhaps twenty feet above you, disappearing into a swirling gray haze.  The

An ancient dragon's lair~
This branch of the caves is completely dry, and any sounds from the distant    
waterfall were blocked out upon entering.  The area here is huge, and an even    
larger alcove appears to have been roughly carved out to the south.  As you    
examine the alcove closer, you notice the stones on the floor, walls and    
ceiling are all heavily scratched, as if a rough material had been rubbed over    
everything repeatedly.  In one corner, partially concealed by dust and fallen    
debris, you find a dull black shield-shaped disk, brittle with age and rough    
around the edges.  The false wall to the west shimmers a magical dull gray    
color, while light comes from the cave to the north.

You brush a bit of the dust off and feel the leathery material.  Almost a    
foot across, the disk looks like a miniature shield.  As you turn it about in    
your hands, you suddenly recognize it for what it is; an ancient black dragon    
scale, brittle and worn with age.    
~
E wall w west~
The wall to the west is a blank gray surface, which swirls slightly as you     
stare at it.  Obviously magical in nature, it appears the illusion was    
designed to hide the opening from the other direction, not from this way.    
As you run your hand against the surface you feel barely a tingle, then your    
fingers pass through the magical barrier.

#12282
A large circular room~
The cave opens up to an obviously unnatural room, perfectly circular in    
shape.  Bronze torches are mounted on the walls every few feet, blazing with    
a steady, magical flame.  To your amazement the room is filled with treasure;    
gold, gems, pieces of gilded armor, and many heavily decorated weapons.  A    
large stone dais dominates the middle of the room, rising twenty feet in the    
air with steps carved all the way up its side.  You see what looks like an    
altar on the top, but can not make out anything else from here.

The bronze torch holders are heavily engraved with ornate patterns across    
the entire surface.  One wooden torch is mounted in each holder, and while it    
appears to burn with a normal flame, they does not seem to consume any fuel,     
nor do they produce any smoke.    
~
E dais~
The dais dominates the center of the room.  It is solid, plain stone, with     
narrow steps carved up far side.    
~
E altar~
The altar appears to be constructed of a solid black material, but you can    
not make out details from this far below it.  It looks like the stairs up    
the side of the dais will lead right to it.

#12283
On a stone ledge~
An outcropping of stone forms this small ledge, wide enough for several     
people to pull themselves out of the frigid waters.  The mist is extremely    
thick this close to the waterfall, barely allowing you to see a dozen feet    
in any direction.  The glowing green fungus again coats every stone     
surface, leaving your footing precarious.  You can make your way back into    
the water, or head towards the cliff face to the east.

Above the underground waterfall~
The cliff face drops off at your feet, in what looks like an extremely    
precarious climb.  Your entire view to the south-west is dominated by the    
billowing cloud of gray mist rising from the lake below.  The stone ceiling    
rises no more than a few feet above your head, causing you to walk slightly    
crouched.  Next to you, the underground river rushes past towards its    
hundred-foot plummet to the lake below.  It looks like you can pick your way    
carefully to the east, along the rivers edge, or take the steep route down    
the cliff face.

The edge of the underground river~
The ceiling begins to decline rapidly here, closing off to un-passable within    
the next fifty feet.  The slippery stone shore provides for poor footing, and    
the underground river rushing by several feet away makes you slightly    
uncomfortable.  You attempt to look further up the rivers path, but can barely    
see beyond the water shooting out of the rapidly-narrowing crevice in the    
stone, leaving you no clue as to where the river originated from.
