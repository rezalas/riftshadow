Heimdall~
Heimdall~
Heimdall, guardian of Bifrost, stands guard over the Rainbow Bridge.                       
~
Standing over 7 feet tall and muscled as only a god can be, Heimdall keeps                       
his unsleeping gaze over the Rainbow bridge.  His trusty Gjallor-horn never                       
leaves his side, and shall remain unwinded until the dread ship Naglfar sails                       
towards Valhalla on the dawn of Ragnarok.

This room was designed for total relaxation.  You can watch television, listen

The Eye of the Hurricane~
The shrieking winds of a monstrous storm surround you, spinning you around                       
in an endless web of fury. But then, in the middle of turmoil, you find a                       
strange calm. You find yourself hovering in the calm eye of a hurricane. All                       
around you you can see the desruction caused by the powerful storm. White                       
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But                       
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above                       
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this                       
storm is going to be here a while.

Walking on the Moon~
The proud and lonely silence of Mare Imbrium surrounds you, as you gaze upon                       
the sterile splendor of the moon.  All around is the velvet curtain of night,                       
studded with a thousand gleaming jewels.  Below you hangs the beautiful                       
fields of Earth, looking fragile and far away, but full of hope.  A sense of                       
wistful regret touches you, as you think about what might have been, and what                       
will be.

The Satin Memorial Reading Room~
Half read books lie everywhere: Yeats, Tennyson, Chandler, Barrie;                       
a battered paperback de Laclos; a dusty leather-bound Donne.  A                       
damp novel perches precariously on the edge of a large bathtub.                       
As your eyes travel beyond the steam rising to the air toward the                       
rose-brambled balcony railing, you notice a well-creased printout                       
of a poem sitting on a the velvet cushions of a rosewood chair

        Purpled thy nail in blood of innocence?

        Find'st not thyself, nor me the weaker now;                       
          'Tis true, then learn how false fears be:                       
          Just so much honour when thou yield'st to me

.       'One is very soon bored of everything, my angel; it is a law                       
        of nature.  It is not my fault.                       
        If, that is to say, that I am bored with an adventure that has                       
        claimed my attentions for four mortal months, it is not my fault.                       
        If, that is to say, my love is equal to your virtue - and that                       
        is certainly saying a great deal - it is not surprising that                       
        one should come to the end at the same time as the other.  It                       
        is not my fault.                       
        A woman that I love madly now insists that I give you up for                       
        her.  It is not my fault.                       
        I quite realize that this is the perfect opportunity to accuse                       
        me of perjury: but if, where nature has gifted men with no                       
        more than constancy, she has given women obstinacy, it is                       
        not my fault.                       
        Believe this, you should take another lover, even as I take                       
        another mistress.  This is good, very good advice: if you                       
        find it bad, it is not my fault.                       
        Good-bye, my angel.  I took you with pleasure, I leave you                       
        without regret.  I shall come back perhaps.  Such is life.                       
        It is not my fault.

A copy of Peter Pan is opened near the end:                       
                       
What sort of form was Hook showing?  Misguided man though he                       
was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in                       
the end he stayed true to the traditions of his race.  The                       
other boys were flying about him now, flouting, scornful; and                       
as he staggered about the deck striking at them impotently, his                       
mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing                       
fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching                       
the wall-game from a famous wall.  And his shoes were right,                       
and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his                       
socks were right.                       
                       
James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still                       
Above the staggering girl, her thighs carressed                       
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,                       
he holds her helpless breast upon his breast.                       
How can those terrified vague fingers push                       
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?                       
And how can body, laid in that white rush,                       
But feel that strange heart beating where it lies?                       
A shudder in the loins engenders there                       
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower                       
And Agammemnon dead.  Being so caught up,                       
So mastered by this brute blood of the air,                       
Did she put on his knowledge with his power                       
Before his indifferent beak could let her drop?

small fist.  As the water comes up over the rocks and ebbs back                       
down, it filters through the spaces and makes an unnerving rattling                       
sound.

It looks comfortable, and the cushions are ivory velvet.

E rose rose-brambled balcony railing~
Climbing white roses have swarmed over the original marble to obscure                       
it almost completely.  The air is sweet not with roses, though,                       
but with Satin's sandalwood perfume.

A Sea Cave~
You are in a small cave in a cliff next to a deep green sea.  Fine                       
gold and pink sand blanket the floor.  Shells are scattered and strewn                       
about.  A blow hole in the roof of the cave allows beams of light to stream                       
in and illuminate the cave.  The wind blows outside the entrance, but                       
you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf                       
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been                       
worn by time into a shape similar to a comfortable chair.

The Archmage's Workroom~
This well-lit room is absolutely filled with clutter -- enchanting gear,                       
reagents, spell components, ancient tomes, scrolls, braziers, exotic incense                       
and countless other tools of the magical trade, all jumbled together with                       
seemingly no attention paid to organization.  You have no doubts that Alander                       
can find whatever he needs without delay, however.  A heavy oak door stands                       
barred to the south, to discourage idle visitors, and Alander's quarters                       
are east.

Office~
The first thing you notice about this office is the floor; it                       
is a black & white checkerboard pattern, with 8 squares to a side.  The                       
south wall is a HUGE picture window that produces a magnificent view of                        
the land.  In front of the window is a large desk.  Completely covering                       
the east wall is a bookshelf, that is crammed full.  In the northwest                       
corner, you notice a statue.

E statue~
You recognize this as a statue of Robert James Fischer, one of the most                        
creative, if not eccentric, players of all time.  The inscription on the

This desk is much larger than anyone could possibly need.  At one end you                        
notice a large, disorderly mass of papers; it must be all his immortal                       
paperwork.  At the other end is a magnificent wooden inlaid board with                       
handcrafted ebony and hardwood pieces.

Arena of Judgement~
The scene lain before you is one that gives you the feeling of being placed                       
under a higher authority.  The jury is out.  A statue of Pontius Pilate is                       
in the aft of the Arena.  Staring balefully, the statue faces a distant                       
hillside where many aged crosses still stand.  The Arena is set in a wide                       
pit-like field of trampled bloodstained grass, and is guarded by high walls                       
of veinous marble.  A bloodstone seat awaits the true paragon of Romanity.

wise to venture upward into the realm of the gods.  But it seems so calm
