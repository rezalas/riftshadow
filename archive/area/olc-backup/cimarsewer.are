Below a filthy shack~
You are on the upper level of the sewers, the drains and pipes are just big    
enough for you to crouch down and walk or crawl with ease on all fours. The    
air is quiet clean, the occasional breeze bringing an unsavory smell. The    
sludge and liquid that lines the ground you don't want to think of what it    
could be. The pipe that you are in is broken and grants you access to the    
floor of a filthy shack above. It appears that many have taken the path you     
have for the cracked pipe is well worn.

A junction within the sewers~
This is a very old drain, it must have been here for years or heavily    
used. The large sections of stone are worn smooth from the water flow, the    
mortar between the pieces has held and currently sprouts an assortment of    
green sludge and outgrowths. You notice that the iron rings here are    
in fact steel and haven't corroded away like some of the iron ones. This is    
a smaller junction than the one to the east, the southward drain is about    
half that of which you stand in.

something just isn't right. There are no food stains on the box, and it is

Under a downpipe within the sewers~
A newer section of pipe has been laid here, made from what looks to be a    
fire heated mudbrick that has been lined with a thick yellow clay. You    
don't feel to safe in here, whoever thought this would hold together must    
have spent a night too many at the local inn.. The down pipe bottoms out    
here and the sewer flows on to the east.

A junction within the sewers~
Breathing through your mouth to avoid the possible inhalation of scents    
that might bring your last meal to visit, you look about at the small    
drain you are within. The drain is compiled from multiple shards of    
mortared slate with the occasional iron ring to give the structure more    
strength. The sludge and liquids slowly trickle off down the drain. This    
junction looks like one you have just recently passed, or was it another    
that you passed earlier?

This is a very old drain, it must have been here for years or heavily

the mortar between the pieces has held and currently sprouts an

This section of the sewers is rather dry compared with the rest. There is    
a large crate with picture playing cards atop and a halberd wedged into the    
corner wall which holds a burning lantern. Strangely enough there seems to    
be no people playing the cards. Then you think you see the shadows move.

you lean in closer to take a look at this small stone that seems extremely

Under the assassin guild~
This room is split level, the upper section has very low head room but also    
has the slide trapdoor that allows entrance up into the assassin guild. The    
lower level has a table with posters of the latest bounty and rewards for    
assassinations.

     "I be Thomas the Quick, I pen dis for those O me

      The casket be full, the casket be empty, Thomas    
      be running quicker than a angry bull. There be    
      some writin on a shield ye might be needin so    
      here it be:  An...."    
    
The letters stop there and as you squint to try and see if any other    
letters are there you notice that the marks are filled with blood.    
Was Thomas quick enough?

a very thick neck is a old hide collar.

neck, what powers it might hold and if it has been looted by crypt thieves    
or not.

E crystal~
This crystal is hanging from a solid silver chain and encased in silver,    
it appears to be covered in hundreds of faceted faces. All the facets    
glimmer as you stare at it and suddenly show hundreds of little pictures    
of your face.

This is truly a massive two-handed sword and must have taken immense

Green mist swirls up from cracks in the floor and is absorbed into the    
fine sigils and runes that line the bottom of the Altar. There is a thick    
dew smell in the air as plasma burst from the west and east wall at the    
same time striking the altar. Shortly following that the altar turns a    
bright purple color as all the runes activate, releasing a bizarre beam    
that is focused upon the heartstone earthing rod in the roof. There is a    
neat bookshelf that appears to hold a single book bound with crystal clips.

green mist. The walls are dug from the rock and earth leaving only slate    
steps as a base to walk upon. To the south you notice movement in the
