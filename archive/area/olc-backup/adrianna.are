Before the main gate~
At the end of the trail a small clearing has been made. There is enough       
room for perhaps five or six horses. Large brushes and small trees line      
the clearing all around you. To the west is a large stone wall perhaps       
eighteen feet high, two battlement towers are situated on either side of      
a large steel bound double oak door gate.

mark that heads straight into the estate. The extremidies of the clearing

E water trough~
A large water trough about six feet by two feet full of water. The water      
seems to not have been used in quiet some time, a slight stagnent smell      
eminates from it.      
~
E gate~
This massive gate has stood strong for years. Hardened by the weather and      
held together by massive steel braces that bind the doors to the massive      
stone mounted hinges that inserted into the wall. There is a large lock on      
the left door that is still functional.

E lock~
The lock on the gate is just a simple key lock, you wish you had a skeleton      
key on you. This lock is as simple as it comes.

The tracks a fairly heavy and the boot prints are rather large. Perhaps a      
giant or titan.

Within the main wall~
The Inner wall has been constructed from massive blocks of stone, each      
piece as big as a bull. Two massive upright pieces of stone have been      
positioned in the corners for the hinges to be fastened to. The room is      
clear of any objects and is bare from the arch ceiling to the paved floor.

~
E quadrangle arch~
This is truely a amazing piece of mansonary, only after staring at it do      
you notice a small seaming gap in the stone work that is to the west side      
of the arch. Lining yourself up with it from underneath you can make out      
what looks to be a drop down portcalius of some sort. Perhaps standing       
under it might not be such a wise idea.

The floor has a small ammount of dirt, but nowhere near as much as to the

another nine massive torches. Piled next to the crate is a large pile of      
ash and fallen soot.      
~
E torch bracket~
The torch bracket has been coated in soot so thick that you can not even       
see the rivets that join the pieces of metal together.      
~
E wooden rack~
This is a old wooden rack that looks to have once been used to hold weapons      
used by guards. Thick gouge marks and cut marks have been left in the edge      
of the wood. Deep cut marks indicate that someone had once tested their       
weapon on a section of the hardwood.      
~
E soot~
The massive buildup of soot provides two usefull pieces of information, the      
first being that it seems few travel here often. The second being that the      
torch has been burning non stop for a very long time.      
~
E crate ~
This crate has nine large torches in it, though it probably held a dozen      
it seems that the crate has not been moved in some time. Thick deposits of      
soot have settled onto the wooden crate edge that holds the torches, even       
the torches themselves have a small deposit of soot apon them. Something      
seems weird.... the spare torch pile is covered in soot, yet one still      
remains burning.      
~

The room is alot warmer that the room below, likely from the constant heat

unlike the room below which was almost square. There is a heavy smell of      
burning torch and everything in the room seems to have a thin film of soot      
covering them, even the guard that is staring at your pressence.

it offers the archer the greatest ammount of protection from being hit by

The whole room is layered in soot, even the floor has a healthy layer of       
soot and dust. You notice that the foot has some foot prints, you trace      
your own tracks and realise that there are none others. The guard has left      
no tracks.

E wooden rack~
The wooden rack on the west wall has a heavy crossbow that has been wound      
and loaded sitting onto. In the rack is a light bow with several quivers      
each quiver containing at least half a dozen arrows. The last quiver is      
half the size of the rest and instead contains steel bolts.      
~
E heavy crossbow~
The crossbow a high tensil strong small bow mounted apon a triggering shaft      
with a launching rail. This heavy crossbow once was probably a very potent      
weapon, now though it is nothing more than a piece of junk. It has been      
left loaded way to long and the strung gut lays losely over the end of the      
bolt. The flex in the steel small bow lost.

The flagstone paving of the coutyard here doesnt seem to be anywhere near      
as worn as other sections. Also the creepers from the garden seem to have      
left it alone as well. The individual pieces of the flag stone dont seem      
to fit all that well large gaps that have not been set with mortar are       
clearly evident.

E Tower~
This isnt a guard tower of any sort, it is way to big for that. The tower      
is as big as the courtyard if not slighly bigger. And looks to be four      
stories high.

The courtyard is paved in flagstone and lined with heavily overgrown      
gardens. The gardens are kept at bay with a knee high stone curbeing.      
Every five feet or so along the edge of the courtyard is a large pillar      
that has been almost overgrown with creeper ivy. A gentle breeze swirls      
around the courtyard in a clockwise direction bringin the fragrance of       
the flowers in the garden to your nose. To the west is a large spear grill      
gate that is overgrowen with ivy and leads to the tower.

E tower~
The tower seems very run down from the outside. The walls are a jigsaw      
puzzle of stones that have been assorted and mortared together. Soaring      
high into the sky there are atleast four levels. There are occasional       
window holes and a balcony at the very top.

staring at the window holes you notice the flicker of a light inside and      
the casting of a shadow within. There is no doubt that there is someone

The inner wall is only half as thick as the outer wall, and seems to be       
more show than function. The stone masonary is still high quality and seems      
quiet solid. But a hardened assult would crumble the wall with ease. The

chisel work and displays a emblem on the key stone at the peak of the arch.

little room to have a room within it. They have managed to squeeze a small

This cell is a complete box of flagstone, each block fits perfectly with      
the other leaving not enough spave to even start to pick at the edges. On

The scorch mark in the stone looks weird, so you kneel down and feel it with

These are spell books, and the lose pages could be used as a scroll one would

twelve feet high and six feet wide. The edges of it are held open by a       
snarling twisting web of energy. Keeping the portal open requires energy      
which is drawn from the web around the edge of the portal. Now and again when      
a section of the web dulls slightly a crackling noise builds up from the east      
and south, then suddenly white and black interlaced bolts strike the web of      
energy from the east and south, restoring its glow.
