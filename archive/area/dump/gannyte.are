sour old man~
a sour old man~
A wine-soaked old man mutters bitter imprecations beneath his breath.    
~
The sour, vinegary smell of clothes soaked in cheap wine and old urine     
rolls off the wrinkled wreck of a man in fetid waves.  He sprawls out in     
languid disregard of your presence, finding comfort in a bed not changed in     
years.  Though he is carved in the soft, flaccid flesh of lethargy and ease,     
his skin hints at a different life long past. His skin is still weathered by     
years spent in the sun and sea, his hands still callused, and his long,     
sprawling legs still corded with the remnants of muscle.  What might have     
once been an industrious fisherman now simply soaks up wine and whispers with     
little energy but much bitterness of the old and better days.

A pristine elven lady preaches the virtues of chastity and industry.    
~
Her long, full white skirts are cut slightly out of fashion, hemmed up to     
the ankle in order to avoid the inches of human waste and filth that carpet     
the floors of these shacks.  A small, tart mouth barks out a vehement sermon     
against the scene of debauchery before her, but her eyes keep a hungry watch     
on every move.  Her delicate pointed ears perk up at every groan. With a     
white silk journal tucked beneath one arm and soft, uncalloused hands     
gesticulating emphatically, she urges her heedless audience to find salvation     
through hard work and purity of mind.

A woman in thin red silk writhes seductively on the bed.    
~
Her clothes and demeanor advertise her profession as openly as a written     
proclamation.  The diaphanous scarlet gown is cut to reveal both the round     
spheres of her breasts and the long, pale lines of her legs.  The red silk is     
thin and cheaply made, designed more for taking off than for wearing.      
Faintly offensive stains mark the fabric.  As she lies on the filthy bed with     
the dirty dress pulled up above her waist, moaning and writhing like a woman     
in the deepest throes of sensual delight, only her eyes reveal a mournful     
story of boredom and self-loathing.

With his lovely, aquiline nose buried in a book of accounts, little can be

she hangs there without a word, struggling with a powerful and obvious desire

obviously his, judging by his delight in counting it, and by the whispers of     
the village he is the owner of the most profitable gambling establishment in     
the town.  His name is an oft-mentioned one in Gannyte Shoals, called "the     
Counter" for both counting the cards while playing and counting his loot     
afterward.  With a grin he hitches his pants of haphazardly assorted shades

sailor~
a drunken sailor~
A drunken sailor wanders the village waterways, bellowing curses.    
~
He shakes his tiny raft with his laughter and antics until it teeters     
dangerously close to spilling him into the filth of the village.  Beating his     
chest madly and snickering between words, he sputters out every foul phrase     
his travels have taught him.  Reaching up with lanky arms, he tries to grab     
the swinging walkways above and topple the pedestrians.  Dancing with glee at     
his mischief, he roars with laughter, then again with profanity.

a little girl~
A sweet-looking little girl sits in the mud with big tears rolling down her cheeks.    
~
Dressed in a dirty white frock, she seems sad and forgotten.  No doubt she     
moves most tourists to sobs of pity.  Her cheeks are unwashed and tiny     
rivulets of tears make pathways through the dirt.  Most who pass her move     
close to comfort her but a careful eye will notice a quick hand ready to     
delve into pocket or purse and steal the treasure within.

an elderly missionary~
A gaunt man in simple white robes cries out a sermon of redemption to the village.    
~
One of the few missionaries here in Gannyte Shoals who seems truly intent on     
his message and true to his doctrine of self-denial, this lean man preaches     
his sermon with the fire of a zealot in his eyes.  Gesticulating fiercely,     
desperate to catch the attention of any one of the villagers, his perch upon     
the walkway teeters, almost pitching him into the water below, but he pays no     
mind to the danger.

a corpulent man~
A corpulent man sits at the table, devouring dish after dish.    
~
Snorting and guzzling like a pig at his trough, this thing is scarecely     
recognizable as human.  Smatters of grease and sauce cover his face and mead     
stains dribble down his white apron, the only piece of clothing large enough     
to cover him. Rolls of fat cover him from chin to knee, and begin again in     
smaller waves down to his feet.   Though the city's grain dole to the village     
is more than generous, he quickly consumes the allotment and pursues richer     
feed.  Laziness and gluttony have motivated him to force his daughter into     
prostitution, that his unending hunger might be sated.

A slatternly young girl roams the village in search of a man, any man.    
~
Doing her best to appear attractive to the passing young men, she is     
nonetheless one of the plainest and ugliest of girls. Her chest is as flat as     
a boy's and her matted red locks reek of vomit and drunken nights.  She     
frequently resorts to shows of helplessness to gain attention, but no one man     
takes her home for more than one night's pleasure.  Her vapid eyes show no     
spark of intelligence, not even the simple cunning of a whore.

A slick-backed toad finds a pleasant home in the muck.

Slipping his rubber legs through the water, the grey-green little creature     
squelches happily in the slime.  Yellow splotches of what appears to be     
parasitic growth but might just be a natural camoflauge in this rancid swamp     
spread in concentric circles across his back.  Unconcerned, he croaks twice     
and plops down into the mire once more.

Sucking lazily along the bottom of the swampy waterbed, this large catfish     
has an ample food supply and little risk of predation.  Larger fish cannot     
swim in these shallow waters and the village fisherman have long since

With its covers slightly ajar to reveal the creamy vellum within, you can see     
no harm in casually glancing at its pages.  Besides, the pure white silk and     
little-girl lace on the cover do not lead you to expect anything but the     
purest of communications.  The handwriting inside is exceedingly fine, with     
the loose, organic flow of elven script.  Coming to the middle, however, you     
notice a section with words sharply slanted and haphazardly arranged as     
though the writer were in a fit of passion...

Though messy, you can discern the words:    
    
...leaping and writhing on a bed of sex-soaked sheets.  The painted harlot's     
cries reach up to heaven as she enjoys each pounding, driving, delicious     
thrust.  The sinner moans with his whore, lost in the ecstasy of his immoral     
act.  He tangles a dirty paw in her dark chestnut hair and she giggles at the     
pain.  May the heavens strike them dead for their sins!  It is only for the     
sake of the mission that I would sit and watch this wicked display.  I suffer     
that others will not have to....

An abandoned shack~
A wind fragrant with the round, gassy smell of human decadence shakes this     
little one-room shack.  The shambling home sways on the tall, rotten stilts     
that hold it up above the waterline.  The wood is warped with damp.  Each     
board bulges away from its neighbor to leave gaping holes in the wall and     
floor.  Though the sprawling decay does not in any way distinguish this shack     
from any other in the village, it is clear that none have lived here for some     
time.  Shards of glass and broken pottery cover the floor.  The thresholds to     
the south and east hang empty, the doors long since stolen.  The one tiny     
window in the northern wall hangs open, ringed with jagged teeth of broken     
glass.  A slick layer of mold still clings to the floor from the last time     
the waters rose to flood level and soaked the small house.  No foot has left     
a mark in the filth nor hand moved to clear the clutter in many years.

Looking through the window, you see the waters recede to the north, giving

A decaying footbridge~
A narrow little rope bridge joins two adjacent shacks, its rotten boards     
unevenly placed.  The faint breeze, lazy as it is, shakes you as you stand,     
exciting a chorus of creaks from the old ropes.  The village has designed its     
own peculiar architecture in order to survive the malarial waters below and     
the incoming tide to the south.  Each ramshackle house is up on long, wobbly     
stilts and passage between them gained by short bridges such as this one.      
Though this design is clever enough and might have once encouraged a close-    
knit society within the village, now each bridge is precariously rotten,     
dripping with parasitic moss, the damp boards wormeaten.  Southward lies the     
relative shelter of another sprawling shack, while the home to the north     
looks dark and uninhabited.

banner, celebrating decay and neglect.  The rope is old and not repaired for     
many years.  It creaks with the burden of your weight and the soft     
encouragement of the wind.

A sprawling shack~
Larger than most homes in the village, this shack, though easily as     
decrepit as the others, is blessed with two rooms rather than one and     
actually contains some meager furnishings.  Three tables with mismatched     
chairs fill the room, each heavy with empty mugs and the remnants of a card     
game.  The floor is smooth and relatively clean, kept from mold and rot by     
the frequent passage of feet in and out of this shack.  A crude tapestry     
hangs on the southern wall, to cover the gaping, glassless window.  Though     
the room is dirty and infested with the smell of decay, there is something     
prosperous and busy about it.  To the west lies a smaller room, from which     
you can hear the faint clinking of gold being counted.  In every other     
direction, a roughly cut doorway allows access to the outside world.

Round wooden tables of differing hues and stages of decay nearly fill the

flagons of mead and recent evidence of a meal. Stray cards are scattered on     
all three tables, seeming to indicate that this is a gambling establishment.    
~
E tapestry~
Hiding a lopsided window and thus obscuring the room from prying eyes, a     
long, ratty tapestry hangs on the southern wall.  Though the color is faded     
and the weave snagged, the subject seems to be a slender, naked woman with     
dice in one hand and a golden wheel in the other.    
~
#10003
The back room~
Smaller than the adjacent room, the tiny office is nearly filled with a     
large wooden desk and the small, lice-infested cot next to it.  The desktop     
is obscured beneath piles of papers, ledger books, and dirty trinkets and     
charms of the most worthless variety.  Moth-eaten velvet bags, presumably     
containing more of the same, fill the space beneath the desk.  A chair much     
too large to suit the desk is placed behind it.  A curious black board hangs     
on the northern wall, covered in an indecipherable scrawl.  Though as dirty     
and unpleasant as any other room in the village, there is in this small     
office the air of possession, the dirty sense of ownership to be found in a     
rat's lair.

stilts and passage between them gained by short bridges such as this one.      
Though this design is clever enough and might have once encouraged a close-    
knit society within the village, now each bridge is precariously rotten,     
dripping with parasitic moss, the damp boards wormeaten.  To the north and

Reeking of stale beer and roasting sweetmeats, this sprawling shack seems

reveal the water beneath but hold your weight without complaint, seemingly     
accustomed to the stamping burden of drunken dancing as well as fierce     
brawls.  Broken chairs lie piled up in the corners while more functional ones     
gather around four assorted tables.  Broken pottery and remnants of food have     
been dropped to the floor but swept to the corners for the sake of     
convenience.  There is no hour of day or night when this slovenly place does     
not echo with raucous laughter or the grating screech of violence.

The kitchen~
A rough stone hearth on the northern wall serves as the oven, though no     
fire burns in it now.  A small chopping block still bloody with butchered     
beef bears a meal of cheeses and sweetmeats to be served to the waiting     
patrons.  The cabinets are mostly bare save for a few stale rinds of bread     
and the salted hams and sides of beef hanging in the meat closet.  Insects     
buzz lazily about the room and the scurrying footfalls of rats reach your     
ears.  If the drunken patrons of the tavern could see the conditions in this     
kitchen, perhaps they might lose their appetite for their meal.  Then again,     
perhaps not.

A greasy little shack~
The air here is rife with the scent of food, that long eaten and that     
freshly served.  The lingering memory of every kind of gustatory indulgence     
can be traced here; scents sweet and salty, meats and fruits and buttery     
breads.  The four walls are closely set, the scant floorspace taken up with a     
dining table and a single chair.  Bones litter the floor and sauces of every     
variety stain the walls as well as the table.  Grease dripped from roasted     
meats makes passage through the shack somewhat slippery.  It is odd to find     
such evidence of gluttony in a home so poor and so ill-tended.  The warped     
wooden boards in the wall let in the elements and the floor creaks with age.      
Whoever inhabits this home has a very peculiar set of priorities.

A blood-stained room~
The details of the room are at first lost on you, overwhelmed by the smell     
and sight of carnage that drips from the walls and gathers in pools on the     
floor.  Handprints in bright red claw the warped floorboards and trail off     
helplessly to the corner of the room.  The sparse furniture seems     
incongruously mundane in such a spectacularly bloody room.  A simple redwood     
table with matching chairs would be perfectly at place in a sun-lit kitchen     
or homely family room if not for the light sprinkling of blood dotting the     
tabletop.  A threadbare rug on the floor was once white but now stained     
maroon.  Strangely not all the stains are fresh.  Though the floor is wet     
with newly shed blood, there are also old brown marks in amorphous     
configurations.  Scuffs from past fights are carved into the walls,     
accompanied by stains scrubbed but not erased.  A guttural moan rises to fill     
the room and you shudder, uncertain if the sound comes from your throat or     
another or simply arises from the faint wind slipping through the rotten     
walls.

A torch-lit room~
No daylight reaches this large room.  The windows are covered by thick     
tapestries and the holes in the wall and floorboards are plugged with mud and     
moss.  In the flickering light of scattered torches the place seems exotic     
and faintly threatening.  Shapes and shadows appear and disappear, dancing on     
the edges of your perception.  Heavy animal pelts hang on every wall, though     
from what animal they were taken you could not say.  The musk of wild     
animals, however, clings to the room.  A shelf on the western wall contains     
row upon row of jars and earthenware filled with mysterious concoctions.  A     
large seat stands against the southern wall, made of earth and bone, looking     
rather like a throne.  A throaty hum of prayer or curse fills the room,     
coming from no particular direction.

A tall shelf of rotting blackwood stands against the western wall.  It is     
richly carved and was once probably quite elegant.  It looks out of place in

concoctions.  A large earthenware bowl holds what appear to be pig's feet     
soaking in a red liquid of some sort.  Numerous stoppered clay pots and glass     
jars line the shelves, but no amount of imagination or discernment can

rubbish covers the floor, interrupted only by a line of tiny, childlike     
footprints that tiptoe from the door into the next room to the bed against     
the southern wall.  No other furniture remains besides the bed, though     
markings on the floor and wall seem to indicate that this was once a     
relatively well-furnished room.  The wood is wet and rotten and will soon     
give way, depositing the unfortunate inhabitants of this home into the     
malarial swamp below.

wall, the sort used to chain animals in a menagerie or prisoners in a     
dungeon.  Dark brown and maroon blotches stain both floor and walls, the     
indelible legacy of some poor victim's blood shed.

bone and animal pelts standing in the center of the room.  The room is humid     
with a strange, heavy scent, an exotic mix of animal blood and the sweaty     
smell of human desperation.  A hairy touch upon the nape of your neck draws     
your eyes toward the ceiling.  Rope-suspended figurines dangle from a roof     
lost in smoky shadows, most carved in human shapes.

An abandoned shack~
A wind fragrant with the round, gassy smell of human decadence shakes this     
little one-room shack.  The shambling home sways on the tall, rotten stilts     
that hold it up above the waterline.  The wood is warped with damp.  Each     
board bulges away from its neighbor to leave gaping holes in the wall and     
floor.  Though the sprawling decay does not in any way distinguish this shack     
from any other in the village, it is clear that none have lived here for some     
time.  Shards of glass and broken pottery cover the floor.  The thresholds to     
the south and west hang empty, the doors long since stolen.  The one tiny     
window in the northern wall hangs open, ringed with jagged teeth of broken     
glass.  A slick layer of mold still clings to the floor from the last time     
the waters rose to flood level and soaked the small house.  No foot has left     
a mark in the filth nor hand moved to clear the clutter in many years.

window pane is the set of ominous glass shards hungrily guarding the opening.      
Looking through the window, you see the waters recede to the north, giving

A one-room shack~
Unlike the sparse, dilapidated furnishings of most of the shacks in the     
village, the furniture in this home is ornate and colorful, if cheaply made.      
Thick, velvety fabrics hang from all four walls.  Slightly faded but still     
bright red carpets cover the floor.  Taking up the majority of the room, an     
ornately carved blackwood canopy bed stands against the northern wall, hung     
with filmy violet drapery.  Though the tracks worn into the thick carpet from     
door to bed would suggest frequent traffic into and out of this room, you see     
no sign of kitchen or bar that might invite customers.  Though someone has     
burned musky incense in an effort to cover the smell, the one-room shack     
still reeks of sweat and wickedness.

The mission center~
Cloaked in white silk or satin drapery from ceiling to floor, the purity of     
this large room is almost blinding after the dingy sights of the village.      
The thick carpets must be frequently replaced, since despite the bustling     
presence of men and women in white garments you can spy no thin or frayed     
patches.  Though spare of trinkets or clutter, the walls are adorned with a     
few excellent portraits of hawk-faced men and women.  A large, organically     
carved desk stands against the eastern wall, bearing neat piles of parchments     
and leather-bound books.  Strangely, despite the obvious wickedness and     
decadence of the villagers and the shocking state of poverty prevalent in the     
town, the air in this, the heart of the mission to convert Gannyte Shoals, is     
brisk with optimism and a sense of purpose.

A large white room~
The large bedroom in this satin-cloaked shack is a shocking contrast to     
every other home in the village.  Though no serious effort has been put into     
permanently repairing the house, wall-length white satin banners cover the     
disfigured wooden boards and flowered silk carpets cover the gaps and bumps     
in the old floor.  Pleasant oil paintings hang from the white-silk walls.      
Rich furnishings stand about the room: a bedstand, a writing desk with     
matching chair, and a large, comfortable bed.  A large window in the southern     
wall looks out onto the beach and the ocean beyond.  A shallow balcony in the     
northwest corner of the room juts out from the building, giving a nearly     
complete view of the messy, sprawling village, such a marked contrast to this     
tidy, clean abode.

furnishings or ornaments adorn the room, only a narrow, filthy bed in the     
corner.  Wine stains spread in maroon rings on the floor.  The air is rife     
with the scent of stale beer and spilled mead.  Glass bottles lie haphazardly     
around the room, some chipped, some shattered and lying dangerously jagged on     
the ground.  Vomit long since dried and hardened sits undisturbed on the     
floorboards.  Nor pictures, shelves, or even windows break the monotony of     
the rotting walls.

A marshy trail~
A waterlogged path of trodden grasses and thick, squelching swamp mud winds     
its way toward the southeast, growing wetter with each step southward.  The     
air is thick with the buzzing of insects and lazy rustlings of animals     
underfoot.  The spot where you stand seems to be some sort of informal line     
of demarcation.  The grasses and trees to the south are substantially more     
overgrown and redolent with the smell of stagnation and rot, while northward     
the way grows clearer.  As though to confirm this intuitive sense of     
boundary, a broken piece of wood that might have once been a sign lies on the     
ground.  Sudden laughter cuts through the humid air, high-pitched, perhaps     
drunken, distant but clearly audible.  A sharp ear may catch the sandpaper     
brush of the waves against the beach far to the south, but not the faintest     
breath of fresh ocean air reaches this spot.

The sodden, marshy weeds give way to every-deepening water, part freshwater     
swamp and part the salty overflow from high tide.  The trail opens up here to     
reveal a rambling, rotten village to the southeast.  Curious looking little     
hovels stand several lengths above the water, elevated on thick but none-too-    
sturdy poles.  The poles are long and once probably quite strong but years of     
neglect have left them teetering and uneven, sprawling like the uncertain     
legs of a newborn colt.  Wicked indulgence wafts from the village itself; the     
brassy smell of lechery, the screeching sound of laughter and violence.  Like     
a symphony the scent and sound permeate the village, running up the hill to     
sing to you here with a kind of disfigured beauty.  Dark green, malarial     
waters cover every inch of land in this small town without road or earth,     
only greasy waterways and makeshift rafts to navigate them.

In place of ordinary streets or roads, this marshy village has only small,     
poorly-tended channels that run between the rows of slant-legged houses.      
Damaged boats and makeshift rafts clog the waterway in spots, abandoned by     
their passengers upon a whim.  The air is thick with the busy hum of insects     
and the waters beneath you writhe with vermin.  A bed of smooth-polished     
rocks once marked the boundaries of the channel, but all that remains is the     
occasional mold-slick marker.  Men and women, many of them from distant lands     
and most crazed with drink, float through the village on teetering rafts.      
What might once have been a prim, sleepy little village became a major port     
with the explosion of the city to the north.  Now Gannyte Shoals is the haunt     
of the decadent and rotten, a painted whore of a village, used for pleasure

The slowly rotting shack above you leaves a small square of shade in which     
to huddle on a sweltering day.  Hiding from the sun and open air, all manner     
of parasitic growth hangs from the shack floor and coats the long, sprawling     
legs upon which the home stands.  Filmy ribbons of algae sway back and forth     
as the water bobs slightly up and down.  Looking overhead you notice cracks     
in the shack floor.  The sounds of smacking and slobbering, chomping and     
grunting come to you, the unmistakable music of a meal being ravenously     
devoured.  The delicious aroma of roasting meats mingles with the rancid     
stench of the stagnant water to make a powerfully repulsive scent linger in     
this spot.

A putrid waterway~
In place of ordinary streets or roads, this marshy village has only small,     
poorly-tended channels that run between the rows of slant-legged houses.      
Damaged boats and makeshift rafts clog the waterway in spots, abandoned by     
their passengers upon a whim.  The air is thick with the busy hum of insects     
and the waters beneath you writhe with vermin.  A bed of smooth-polished     
rocks once marked the boundaries of the channel, but all that remains is the     
occasional mold-slick marker.  Men and women, many of them from distant lands     
and most crazed with drink, float through the village on teetering rafts.

The slowly rotting shack above you leaves a small square of shade in which     
to huddle on a sweltering day.  Hiding from the sun and open air, all manner     
of parasitic growth hangs from the shack floor and coats the long, sprawling     
legs upon which the home stands.  Filmy ribbons of algae sway back and forth     
as the water bobs slightly up and down.  Looking overhead you notice cracks     
in the shack floor.  The screech of heathen laughter combined with the     
tempting clinking of gold coins comes to you from those cracks, drawing your     
attention to the home above.

Sandy docks~
The land here is remarkably dry, compared to the sunken swampland to the     
north.  The beating of the waves has washed up sand and debris to form a kind     
of embankment, upon which the villagers have built a long wooden dock that     
runs nearly the length of the village.  The vast, clean expanse of ocean to     
the south only serves to further emphasize the crowded, malarial filth of the     
village.  Houses held above the water on long, sprawling stilts stand gape-    
windowed in various stages of decay.  The wretched cries of children mingle     
with the screeching of whores and revelers to make a sad, decadent music.

A putrid waterway~
In place of ordinary streets or roads, this marshy village has only small,     
poorly-tended channels that run between the rows of slant-legged houses.      
Damaged boats and makeshift rafts clog the waterway in spots, abandoned by     
their passengers upon a whim.  The air is thick with the busy hum of insects     
and the waters beneath you writhe with vermin.  A bed of smooth-polished     
rocks once marked the boundaries of the channel, but all that remains is the     
occasional mold-slick marker.  Men and women, many of them from distant lands     
and most crazed with drink, float through the village on teetering rafts.      
What might once have been a prim, sleepy little village became a major port     
with the explosion of the city to the north.  Now Gannyte Shoals is the haunt     
of the decadent and rotten, a painted whore of a village, used for pleasure     
but never as a permanent home.  Broken-down houses stand well above the water     
to the south, while the land rises from the muck to form an impenetrable     
forest to the north.

Beneath a leaning shack~
The slowly rotting shack above you leaves a small square of shade in which     
to huddle on a sweltering day.  Hiding from the sun and open air, all manner     
of parasitic growth hangs from the shack floor and coats the long, sprawling     
legs upon which the home stands.  Filmy ribbons of algae sway back and forth     
as the water bobs slightly up and down.  Looking overhead you notice cracks     
in the shack floor.  Dark, coagulated blood drips slowly from the cracks,     
falling to the swampy waters to give them a faint red tinge.  The rancid     
waters of the channel lie all around you.

The land here is remarkably dry, compared to the sunken swampland to the     
north.  The beating of the waves has washed up sand and debris to form a kind     
of embankment, upon which the villagers have built a long wooden dock that

Sandy docks~
The land here is remarkably dry, compared to the sunken swampland to the     
north.  The beating of the waves has washed up sand and debris to form a kind     
of embankment, upon which the villagers have built a long wooden dock that     
runs nearly the length of the village.  The vast, clean expanse of ocean to     
the south only serves to further emphasize the crowded, malarial filth of the     
village.  Houses held above the water on long, sprawling stilts stand gape-    
windowed in various stages of decay.  The wretched cries of children mingle     
with the screeching of whores and revelers to make a sad, decadent music.

Beneath a leaning shack~
The slowly rotting shack above you leaves a small square of shade in which     
to huddle on a sweltering day.  Hiding from the sun and open air, all manner     
of parasitic growth hangs from the shack floor and coats the long, sprawling     
legs upon which the home stands.  Filmy ribbons of algae sway back and forth     
as the water bobs slightly up and down.  Looking overhead you notice cracks     
in the shack floor.  Not the faintest sign of life is visible through those     
cracks, nor do the shuffling sounds of inhabitation come to you from the     
shack.  To the north, the land rises up out of the muck into an impenetrable     
forest.

A corner of the village~
The land rises slightly, emerging to form a dense forest to the north and     
east.  From this vantage point, you can see most of the village.  From afar     
the picture of debauchery loses all its wicked glamour, merging into a hazy     
picture of sadness. Desperate lives scatter back and forth across the     
teetering walkways.  Pathetic tragedy plunges into the mold-green waters.      
Little fishing boats would once have bustled to and fro in this village,     
going out to sea for a day's work and returning with a hearty catch.  Now     
worm-eaten fragments of these boats float the waterways.  A sense of the     
profound loss washes over you.

Beneath the greasy surface of the water, beneath floating debris and filmy     
sheets of algae, the swamp waters of the village surround you.  Refuse of all     
kinds rest on the murky bottom, covered with sludge, few things identifiable.      
The filthy pollution of broken bottles, decaying wood, and human waste dumped     
from the shacks above makes for dark waters. Looking around to the distance,     
you notice the monotony of darkness and waterlogged trash broken by the     
occasional wooden pole, driven deep into the ground to support the shacks     
above.  The water recedes to the west, yielding to soggy land.

In murky water~
Beneath the greasy surface of the water, beneath floating debris and filmy     
sheets of algae, the swamp waters of the village surround you.  Refuse of all     
kinds rest on the murky bottom, covered with sludge, few things identifiable.      
The filthy pollution of broken bottles, decaying wood, and human waste dumped     
from the shacks above makes for dark waters. Looking around to the distance,     
you notice the monotony of darkness and waterlogged trash broken by the     
occasional wooden pole, driven deep into the ground to support the shacks     
above. The land rises to form a sandy beach to the south.
