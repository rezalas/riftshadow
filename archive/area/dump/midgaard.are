Kate's Diner~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through      
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the      
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,      
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards      
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some      
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the      
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window      
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock      
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south      
returns you to Austral Square.      
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing      
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival      
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

Melancholy's Maps~
As you walk in, a sudden gust of wind enters the shop and sends several      
scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred       
up stings your eyes, and take a look around the shop.  This shop is cluttered       
with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with       
slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll       
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the right of you,       
and to the left is a window overlooking the Large Intersection.  A small door,

A Money Changer's Room~
A few strategically placed lanterns keep this place well-lit in the       
absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with        
tapestries hanging on the walls.  You'd wager your life the moneylender's      
guards are behind them, as there are none here.  The moneylender himself      
works from behind a large desk, no doubt holding a fortune in gold and silver.      
A smallish sign hangs on the wall, lettered in common.

Mage's Laboratory~
This is the Magical Experiments Laboratory.  Dark smoke-stained stones      
arch over numerous huge oaken tables, most of these cluttered with strange-      
looking pipes and flasks.  The floor is covered with half-erased pentagrams      
and even weirder symbols, and a blackboard in a dark corner has only been      
partially cleaned, some painful-looking letters faintly visible.  A well in      
the middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the      
depths.

E tower towers~
Both of the towers are built from large grey rocks that have been fastened to      
each other with some kind of mortar, just like the city wall.      
~
E gate~
It is a set of very big double doors made from hard wood.  They have been      
reinforced with large iron bands to make them even more sturdy.  One of the      
doors is equipped with a very big lock.      
~
E bridge footbridge~
It is too high up to reach but it looks as if one easily could walk across it      
from one tower to the other.

By the Temple Altar~
You are by the temple altar in the northern end of the Temple of Midgaard.      
A huge altar made from white polished marble is standing in front of you and      
behind it is a ten foot tall sitting statue of Odin, the King of the Gods.      
The back of the altar opens into a a beautiful atrium, above which can be      
seen a rainbow.

E statue king god~
The statue represents the Great God Zed, holding a staff.  He has long, grey      
hair and beard and a kindly look on his face.  His staff is topped by a painted      
cube, the 6 faces of which represent the 6 aspects of his power.      
~
E altar~
Even though the altar is more than ten feet long it appears to be made from a      
single block of white virgin marble.

The Fountain of Youth Apothecary~
An old man putters around behind the counter, making strange love potions      
and curative philtres.  He turns as you enter, and looks on with avarice.      
Judging from the furnishings, he's been made very wealthy by his trade.
