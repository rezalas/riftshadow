face this monk seems to see where he is wandering, even tho he wanders in    
circles.

Forests lining the Old Southern Road~
Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to    
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that    
has survived above all others.

Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into dry puddles. Two deep

grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions    
indicating that the road has not seen regular use in some time. On the

blades hang out over the road.

The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above    
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird    
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't    
sound dangerous.

occasional shrub and small bush. Large rocks can be seen raising their    
head above the tips of the long grasses, lizards absorbing the heat lay

Along the Old Southern Road.~
Portions of the paved road have sunken into the wet ground making the    
road uneven. Pave corners that are exposed are heavily worn and give the    
road a worn riverbed look, ripples of living stone. Raised mounds of dirt    
grow a short cropped layer of grass that is finger than the other wide    
bladed grass that you have encountered.

Forests lining the Old Southern Road.~
Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to    
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that    
has survived above all others.

The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above

Deep within the thick forest.~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above    
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird    
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't    
sound dangerous.

Deep within the thick forest.~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above    
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird    
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't    
sound dangerous.

Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to

has survived above all others.

grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions

Portions of the paved road have sunken into the wet ground making the    
road uneven. Pave corners that are exposed are heavily worn and give the    
road a worn riverbed look, ripples of living stone. Raised mounds of dirt    
grow a short cropped layer of grass that is finger than the other wide    
bladed grass that you have encountered.
