Forests lining the Old Southern Road.~
Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to    
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that    
has survived above all others.

Fields of the Old Southern Road.~
Grasses cover the undulating ground of the fields to the side of the old    
southern road. Sprouting up from the thick weave of grasses is the    
occasional shrub and small bush. Large rocks can be seen raising their    
head above the tips of the long grasses, lizards absorbing the heat lay    
on the surface. The winds passing over the grasses flows like a river    
weaving in and out through the rocks and bushes.

At a paved roads end.~
The paved road is swallowed up buy the layers of dust then finally by the    
grasses. Goat trails lead in all directions from here, as if the road had    
never continued onwards. Cutting corners to another road or just leading    
of into the forest, the trails snake widely. These trails are more worn    
than that of the road indicating that their use is still regular enough    
to keep the grasses at bay.

sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above

noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't    
sound dangerous.

Forests lining the Old Southern Road.~
Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to    
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that    
has survived above all others.

Deep within the thick forest.~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above    
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird    
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't    
sound dangerous.

Fields of the Old Southern Road.~
Grasses cover the undulating ground of the fields to the side of the old    
southern road. Sprouting up from the thick weave of grasses is the    
occasional shrub and small bush. Large rocks can be seen raising their    
head above the tips of the long grasses, lizards absorbing the heat lay    
on the surface. The winds passing over the grasses flows like a river    
weaving in and out through the rocks and bushes.

Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into dry puddles. Two deep    
tracks run down each side of the road from the heavy carts that use it,    
grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions    
indicating that the road has not seen regular use in some time. On the    
edge of the road the grass thrives and grows to almost two feet, long    
blades hang out over the road.

The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above

Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to

Portions of the paved road have sunken into the wet ground making the    
road uneven. Pave corners that are exposed are heavily worn and give the    
road a worn riverbed look, ripples of living stone. Raised mounds of dirt    
grow a short cropped layer of grass that is finger than the other wide    
bladed grass that you have encountered.

Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to    
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that    
has survived above all others.

Deep within the thick forest.~
The moisture level within here is slightly higher than on the edge, the    
smell of the forest floor floods your nose. Decaying vegitation and the    
smell of pollen aren't a aweful smell, but it still blocks out all other    
sense of smell. Light flickers through the canopy as the winds above    
ripple their way across the tops of the taller trees. There is a weird    
noise now and again that seems unlike a bird or a animal, but it doesn't    
sound dangerous.

Curls of dust wisp over the paved road forming into dry puddles. Two deep    
tracks run down each side of the road from the heavy carts that use it,    
grass and weeds striving for a footing sprout out in all directions    
indicating that the road has not seen regular use in some time. On the    
edge of the road the grass thrives and grows to almost two feet, long    
blades hang out over the road.

Closest to the road are short trees and large shrubs stretching towards    
the expanse of light that shines over the road. The canopy of the trees    
have left the forest floor bare, covered only with fallen vegetation.    
The trees are closely packed granting only enough space for a horse to    
pass between the trunks, occasionally there is a great oak or pine that    
has survived above all others.
