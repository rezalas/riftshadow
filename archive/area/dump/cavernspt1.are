Entrance to the caverns of Thargeld~
Deep underground the warmth of the surface greatly lacks as a shiver runs   
down your spine. The lack of light heightens your awareness for both smell   
and noise. The drip of a fluid, the pitt-patta of some small insectacoid.   
The cold yet slightly moist smell that travels on the consistent but weak   
breeze holds a unnatural bite to it. Something in the back of your mind   
sparks a warning that at this depth within the earth such things shouldn't   
be, this environment should be inhospitable.

Your mind starts to play tricks on you as you gaze about in the darkness   
staring at where you assume the walls are. Your perception of depth    
almost lost, you raise your hands grasping for the touch of a surface.   
Reassured that you have not in fact tumbled into the abyss of darkness you   
regain your composure and pay more attention to what you can hear and

Deep underground the warmth of the surface greatly lacks as a shiver runs   
down your spine. The lack of light heightens your awareness for both smell   
and noise. The drip of a fluid, the pitt-patta of some small insectacoid.   
The cold yet slightly moist smell that travels on the consistent but weak

Your mind starts to play tricks on you as you gaze about in the darkness   
staring at where you assume the walls are. Your perception of depth    
almost lost, you raise your hands grasping for the touch of a surface.   
Reassured that you have not in fact tumbled into the abyss of darkness you   
regain your composure and pay more attention to what you can hear and    
smell.
