male dragon olive gold~
an olive and gold dragon~
An olive and gold dragon bellows deafeningly.      
~
At first glance, he appears to be preparing to attack. But as you       
watch him more closely, you realize he's...singing? With incredulous       
awe, you watch as he begins to shuffle about as he attempts to lure       
the female dragons to mate with him.

A turquoise and garnet dragon shuffles menacingly.      
~
With stunned amazement, you realize that he's not preparing to       
attack, but performing a crude, ritualistic mating dance. As       
you gaze about, you see that the females are ignorning him with       
a studied lack of indifference.

A sable and silver dragon rakes the ground with his claws.

He throws back his shiny silver head and roars demandingly for       
the females to mate with him.  Despite the crudeness of his       
vocalizations, you can sense a sing song quality to them that       
perfectly matches the ritualistic, shuffling dance he is performing.

The Long Sands~
Pure white sands stretch out as far as the eyes can see, glittering    
blindingly in both sunlight and moonlight.  Barely discernable, an occasional    
lizard or snake can be seen hiding in the shade of the many cactus standing    
lookout over the desert.  A few large, pink flowers, in various states of    
bloom,  against the green backdrop of the cactus', are the only color to be    
seen.

The Long Sands~
Glittering brightly in any light, the desert stretches out in every    
direction like a brilliant diamond.  Deep, intricate patterns are cut into the    
powdery  foundation, shifting each time a wind storm blows through.  In    
several places, the sands are piled high against large, green cactus', which    
stand in brilliant contrast to the milky landscape.

The Long Sands~
Massive cactus', sparsley covered in bright pink flowers, stand sentinel    
over the Long Sands.  Their thorns, as long and thick as human fingers, cast    
eerie shadows across the pure white expanse, which stretches for miles in    
every direction.  A few tumbleweeds skitter about, bringing a little bit of    
movement to an otherwise unmoving backdrop.

Entrance to Rivenrock Canyon~
Twin spires, carved long ago from the river that used to flow through the    
Long Sands, stand sentry before the entrance to Rivenrock Canyon.  Reaching    
all the way to the clouds, rings of color, from dull to bright, trace their    
way up to the pinnacles of these awe inspiring monuments of a long gone    
waters.

If not for the sheer size of the canyon, you would easily feel overwhelmed    
and a bit dizzy by the walls towering above you, closing you in on all sides    
but for a mere passageway, barely one horse wide, leading out to the Long    
Sands.  The walls themselves are dotted with substantial sized caves, only    
accessible by way of the tiny pathways crisscrossing the walls at convulted    
angles.  Whoever carved them out long ago should have planned it more    
carefully.

Massive stone walls loom above you on all sides, making you feel a bit

cliff's face.  Small pathways can be seen crisscrossing the walls, sometimes    
curving back upon themselves.  A tiny passageway is the only means of escape    
from the canyon, and looking at the size of the caverns, you begins to wonder    
if leaving while you still can wouldn't be a bad idea.

Small rocks litter the ground, eroded away from the cliff walls towering    
high above the canyon, crunching softly beneath your feet.  You glance around    
and see dozens of pathways, barely discernable to the eye, crisscrossing the    
cliffs.  The pathways, obviously man-made, lead to the caverns that abound    
throughout the canyon.  Although they appear small from this great distance,    
they are obviously massive in size to easily accomadate their over large    
inhabitants.

End of a Large Cavern~
Egg shell shards litter the ground, shimmering like the silt covered ground.     
Upon closer inspection, you realize that the shells and silt are solid gold    
created from hatchling fire as they dry their wings or try to make a meal of    
one another before the outer wall is broken down.

A Precarious Path~
Loose stones shift precariously beneath your feet, causing you to struggle    
to retain your balance.  At times, the ledge is so narrow you find yourself    
crawling on your hands and knees just to avoid falling down the sheer, cliff    
wall to the rock strewn desert below.

Entrance to a Large Cavern~
Built up and torn down again over and over by hatchling dragon fire, the    
cavernous space is large enough to comfortably hold a female dragon ready to    
lay her eggs.  Large boulders, blackened from the fires, are strewn across the    
pathway, partially blocking the entrance to the cave, which reverbrates with    
each little sound.  With a sense of trepedition, you wonder if the occupants    
are currently in residence.

A Precarious Path~
Debris from the eroding canyon makes traversing the narrow pathways zig-   
zagging the cliff walls difficult at the best of times and almost impossible    
where the paths have nearly crumbled away.  Slipping and sliding as you make    
your way around, you desperately look for handholds to help you retain your    
balance.

Sculpted by a river long past, the cave was made larger by the claws of the    
dragons who used it to nest, easily accomodating a she-dragon and her mate.     
Debris from the carvings lay all about, used to build up the wall that    
incubates the eggs, then broken down again when the hatchlings make their way    
to daylight.  A shimmering silt covers the ground.
