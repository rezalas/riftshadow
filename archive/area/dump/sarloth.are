A small brown and white rabbit is here, head held to the sky to sniff the     
air for predators.  Ears twitching from side to side to take in the sounds     
of the surrounding forest, the rabbit cautiously continues to chew on the     
grass.

A fierce-looking badger is here, digging in the dirt.

This shortlegged badger seems harmless at first, its pointy face striped     
with black and white fur.  By looking at its flat, fuzzy body, you would     
think it to have difficulty moving about, but it moves along rather quickly,     
even with long claws raking the ground.

Covered in leaves, dirt and twigs, the scout crouches down within the     
heavy brush that of the forest, attempting to remain unseen.  Bright     
eyes glance over your attire, trying to discern what social class you     
come from.  He then eyes your purse, but not in a greedy manner like     
many bandits do.

Meirad doesn't appear to be older than any of the other bandits you    
have come across in your journeys through the forest, but an air of    
experience surrounds him.  There is also something in the way he holds    
himself that reminds you of nobility.  A wolf's pelt is clasped around    
his neck to symbolize his ranking in the clan, and a belt decorated with     
small hunting knives holds up the breeches fashioned from deerskin.  A     
hunting spear is held casually in one hand.

have done every waking second before.  A wolf's pelt is clasped around    
his neck symbolizing his rank, and a belt decorated with small hunting     
knives holds up the breeches fashioned from deerskin.  A wooden bow     
strung with sinew is slung over one shoulder along with a quiver filled     
with arrows.  Despite his crude attire, there is something in the way    
of a noble's air about him.

the fresh deer tracks on the forest floor.  His clothing is made of all    
green and brown cloth so that he might better blend in with the forest    
surroundings.  A quiver of arrows is slung over his shoulder and a

Black ink swirls of all sorts of strange designs lie in permanence    
beneath the pale skin of this man's chest.  His eyes look smaller

rather disturbing visage, he wears nothing more than an embroidered    
loincloth.  He sharpens a large knife in one hand.

An old dirt track~
Scuttling beetles and sprigs of grass look to be the only creatures that    
actively use the dusty old track beneath your feet.  Shadows play across    
the ground thanks to the gentle breeze that tugs at your clothing.  You     
notice several ruts in the dirt, likely from the traffic of wagons that    
may have once passed through here.  Pines, spruce and oak trees speckle    
the landscape all around you, branches swaying under an unseen force.    
The track meanders north and south, where the trees begin to grow more    
thickly together.  Before you make your decision, you spot an old and    
rotted post pounded into the ground, bearing a small wooden sign.

The ruts in the track have completely disappeared now, and an array of     
plants have sprung up from the swiftly disappearing trail.  A strange

by the damp, heavy air beneath the canopy.  A variation of full, leafy    
plants and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient    
trees.  A dirt track leads north away from the trees, or you can venture

A path through the forest~
Somehow you still manage to find a path through dense darkness of     
the forest.  Oaks and pines reach sky high, creating treetop homes     
and pathways of their own for the busy, scurrying life of the tiny     
forest creatures.  Any light reaching down from the sky has been     
extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The sounds of chirping     
of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced, leaving you with     
an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants and flowers press     
close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.  Pine needles

A hidden path~
Through luck or fate, you stumble upon poorly hidden (but hidden none    
the less) path in the heart of the forest.  Like the rest of the woods,    
the sounds of every day life of squirrels and birds has hushed to dead    
silence.  While picking your way through the tangled undergrowth, you     
hear a rustle coming from within one of the nearby bushes.  Passing the     
noise off as nothing more than movement of some nocturnal creatures, you     
search along the ground on hands and knees, attempting to find where the     
path leads.

A well hidden trail~
Somehow you have stumbled upon a trail placed with broken tree limbs    
and loose foliage.  It's very likely that someone wanted this path kept    
well hidden from passerbys, and now you have managed to unearth its only    
visible entrance.  The trees surrounding the path seem to bend in your    
way in a vain attempt to keep the remainder of the trail under guard.    
Light reaches down between limbs and leaves, casting a few lonely shadows    
across the mess before you.  The sounds of chirping of birds and chattering    
of creatures has silenced, leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation     
of full, leafy plants and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks     
of the ancient trees.  The path might continue in some direction, but it's    
going to take you some time to figure out which.

A path through the forest~
Somehow you still manage to find a path through dense darkness of     
the forest.  Oaks and pines reach sky high, creating treetop homes and     
pathways of their own for the busy, scurrying life of the tiny forest     
creatures.  Any light reaching down from the sky has been extinguished     
by the thickly leaved branches.  The sounds of chirping of birds and     
chattering of creatures has silenced, leaving you with an eerie feeling.      
A variation of full, leafy plants and flowers press close against the     
gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.  Pine needles snap beneath your    
feet, protesting as you continue through the woods.

Edge of a dark forest~
You find yourself standing at the edge of a thick, dark forest.  Any     
light reaching down to the trail from the sky has been extinguished by     
thickly leaved branches.  Oaks and pines reach sky high, creating treetop     
homes and pathways of their own for the busy, scurrying life of the tiny     
forest creatures.  The chirping of birds and chattering of creatures seems     
muffled by the damp, heavy air beneath the canopy.  A variation of full,     
leafy plants and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the     
ancient trees.  A dirt track leads south away from the trees, or you can     
venture north into the darkness of the forest.

An old dirt track~
The forest looms just north of where you stand, the dirt track leading    
directly into the thick of it.  The busy beetles that scurried about    
before have now taken shelter beneath the forest's hovering shadows.    
The ruts in the track have completely disappeared now, and an array of     
plants have sprung up from the swiftly disappearing trail.  A strange     
silence weighs heavily at the entrance, trees knit closely together like     
a warm woolen sweater.  The track meanders south and north, toward the    
dead quiet of the forest.

Beneath a large oak tree~
A gigantic tree stands proudly before you, branches and leaves shaking    
as if it had a mind of its own.  The girth of the tree is outstanding,    
likely taking ten or so of you with arms outstretched encircle it.  In    
the highest reaches of the tree, rickety pathways and bridges run from    
branch to swaying branch.  A ladder made from rope dangles down against    
the bark, beckoning you for a climb.  The sounds of chirping of birds     
and chattering of creatures carries on all around you, soothing any    
fears you have of being lost in the woods.  A variation of full, leafy

This is perhaps one of the largest trees you have come across while    
traveling through the forest.  It seems odd that it would stand as near

heart of a forest.  Ants climb through the mountains and vales made by    
the thick, rough bark.

Light from the sky reaches through the tangled leaves and branches

gentle buzzing of honey bees.  A variation of full, leafy plants and

A tiny treetop fort~
For all the bending and swaying of the oak tree's branches, this compact    
yet useful hideout proves to be very sturdy.  A small wooden table has    
been secured on the platform for general use.  A quiver full of arrows    
leans peacefully against a tree branch, but peacefully for how long is    
unknown.  You find it strange that the bandits who inhabit the area would    
build a place like this until you see the breathtaking view to the north.    
A clear shot of the track outside the forest can be seen from the cover     
of the leaves, creating an excellent scouting advantage over any wouldbe    
travelers.  A flimsy rope bridge connects to a tree directly east of you,    
otherwise the ladder leading down to the forest floor remains.

Within a dark forest~
Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants     
and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.

At the edge of a small clearing~
Neatly trimmed undergrowth marks the edge of the small clearning that    
you have stumbled upon.  The ground is well trodden here, packed dirt    
blanketed thickly with pine needles.  Though a few tree limbs reach out    
over the clearing, the sky beyond is easily visible, and allowing for    
a greater light source.  In addition to the humming of forest life, the    
sound of bandits hard at work with their chores blends in, just barely    
distinguishable from the natural forest noise.  The melodic chirping of     
songbirds stands out of the drone, carrying on despite the continual work    
presence of the bandits.  Likely they have grown used to them.  You can    
follow along the edge of the clearing to the south and east, while the    
puzzling forest encroaches everywhere else.

At the edge of a small clearing~
Neatly trimmed undergrowth marks the edge of the small clearning that    
you have stumbled upon.  The ground is well trodden here, packed dirt    
blanketed thickly with pine needles.  Though a few tree limbs reach out    
over the clearing, the sky beyond is easily visible, and allowing for    
a greater light source.  In addition to the humming of forest life, the    
sound of bandits hard at work with their chores blends in, just barely    
distinguishable from the natural forest noise.  The melodic chirping of     
songbirds stands out of the drone, carrying on despite the continual work    
presence of the bandits.  Likely they have grown used to them.  You can    
follow along the edge of the clearing to the south and north, while the    
puzzling forest encroaches everywhere else.

The center of a bandit camp~
Seedlings and other undergrowth has been cleared away to make an inviting    
area around the campfire.  A few tree logs rest sleepily in the wake of    
the crackling flames, waiting for the bandits to rest wearily with them.    
Stones guard the flames, keeping them contained from the easily excitable    
pine needles and dried leaves of the past autumn.  An iron kettle nestles     
within the outer coals of the fire, likely containing the next meal for the    
bandits.  The noise of the camp itself is quite hushed in attempt to keep     
their lair hidden from outsiders.  The camp spreads out around you, hidden    
within the forests arms.

Light from the sky reaches through the tangled leaves and branches    
above to shed thin rays upon the forest undergrowth.  The humming of    
every day forest life blends into a soothing drone, not unlike the    
gentle buzzing of honey bees.  A variation of full, leafy plants and     
flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.     
The melodic chirping of songbirds stands out of the drone, confirming

Within a dark forest~
Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants

Beside a clear running stream~
You feel a cool, clear stream cross your path as you continue to wander     
through the darkness of the forest.  The flow of the water feels like it     
runs from northeast to southwest as it continues its travels through the     
maze of undergrowth and tree trunks.  You can feel a few barren spots of     
trodden dirt cling close to the water, impressed with the split hooved     
tracks of deer.  The strange silence surrounds you still, only broken by    
the soft gurgle of the stream.  The darkness of the forest prevents you     
from regaining your sense of direction.

Within a dark forest~
Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants     
and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.     
The darkness of the forest prevents you from regaining your sense of    
direction.

Beside a clear running stream~
You feel a cool, clear stream cross your path as you continue to wander     
through the darkness of the forest.  The flow of the water feels like it     
runs from northeast to southwest as it continues its travels through the     
maze of undergrowth and tree trunks.  You can feel a few barren spots of     
trodden dirt cling close to the water, impressed with the split hooved     
tracks of deer.  The strange silence surrounds you still, only broken by    
the soft gurgle of the stream.  The darkness of the forest prevents you     
from regaining your sense of direction.

Light from the sky reaches through the tangled leaves and branches

every day forest life blends into a soothing drone, not unlike the    
gentle buzzing of honey bees.  A variation of full, leafy plants and

sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with the faint sound of running water.  A variation of full,     
leafy plants and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the     
ancient trees.  The darkness of the forest prevents you from regaining     
your sense of direction.

Beside a clear running stream~
You feel a cool, clear stream cross your path as you continue to wander     
through the darkness of the forest.  The flow of the water feels like it     
runs from northeast to southwest as it continues its travels through the     
maze of undergrowth and tree trunks.  You can feel a few barren spots of     
trodden dirt cling close to the water, impressed with the split hooved     
tracks of deer.  The strange silence surrounds you still, only broken by    
the soft gurgle of the stream.  The darkness of the forest prevents you     
from regaining your sense of direction.

Light from the sky reaches through the tangled leaves and branches    
above to shed thin rays upon the forest undergrowth.  The humming of    
every day forest life blends into a soothing drone, not unlike the    
gentle buzzing of honey bees.  A variation of full, leafy plants and

The melodic chirping of songbirds stands out of the drone, confirming

Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants     
and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.     
The darkness of the forest prevents you from regaining your sense of    
direction.

Within a light forest~
Light from the sky reaches through the tangled leaves and branches    
above to shed thin rays upon the forest undergrowth.  The humming of    
every day forest life blends into a soothing drone, not unlike the    
gentle buzzing of honey bees.  A variation of full, leafy plants and     
flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.     
The melodic chirping of songbirds stands out of the drone, confirming

A cool, clear stream crosses your path as you continue to wander through    
the forest.  The flow of the water runs from northeast to southwest as it

The eerie silence that has continued on through this darker part of the    
forest continues into the clearing sprawled before you.  The ground that    
lies beneath your feet appears to be well trodden, impressions of bare    
feet meshed together on the dirt.  Toward the center of the clearing you    
can't miss the large altar carved of stone standing proudly.  The limbs    
of the tress behind you hug the clearing tightly and you feel as though    
they are trying to push you toward the altar.  You can either do as they    
suggest, continue along the edge or return to the thick of the forest to     
the north and west.

A variation of full, leafy plants and flowers press close against the

In every direction you see the living puzzle of the forest.

Within a dark forest~
Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with the faint sound of running water.  A variation of full,

ancient trees.  The darkness of the forest prevents you from regaining

At the edge of a clearing~
The eerie silence that has continued on through this darker part of the    
forest continues into the clearing sprawled before you.  The ground that    
lies beneath your feet appears to be well trodden, impressions of bare    
feet meshed together on the dirt.  Toward the center of the clearing you    
can't miss the large altar carved of stone standing proudly.  The limbs    
of the tress behind you hug the clearing tightly and you feel as though    
they are trying to push you toward the altar.  You can either do as they    
suggest, continue along the edge or return to the thick of the forest to

Before a stone altar~
Crafted completely from one piece of granite, the large altar stands    
omniously in the center of the clearing.  Strange geometric shapes are    
carved into the sides of the huge rock, and the top of the altar is so    
smooth that you can see a vague reflection of yourself on it.  The whole    
of the altar is immaculately clean, though wear from the weather and    
from use is apparent.  Every form of life within the clearing has been    
stilled, either out of respect for the monument or fear.  The clearing    
leaves a wide berth in every direction from the altar.

A cool, clear stream crosses your path as you continue to wander through

few barren spots of trodden dirt cling close to the water, decorated with     
the split hooved tracks of deer.  The humming of every day forest life

Within a dark forest~
Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants     
and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.     
The darkness of the forest prevents you from regaining your sense of

A gigantic tree stands proudly before you, branches and leaves shaking    
as if it had a mind of its own.  The girth of the tree is outstanding,

Within a dark forest~
Huge trees huddle together in every direction.  Oaks and pines reach     
sky high, creating treetop homes and pathways of their own for the busy,     
scurrying life of the tiny forest creatures.  Any light reaching down     
from the sky has been extinguished by the thickly leaved branches.  The     
sounds of chirping of birds and chattering of creatures has silenced,    
leaving you with an eerie feeling.  A variation of full, leafy plants     
and flowers press close against the gigantic trunks of the ancient trees.     
The darkness of the forest prevents you from regaining your sense of

A tiny treetop fort~
For all the bending and swaying of the oak tree's branches, this compact    
yet useful hideout proves to be very sturdy.  A small wooden table has    
been secured on the platform for general use.  A quiver full of arrows    
leans peacefully against a tree branch, but peacefully for how long is    
unknown.  You find it strange that the bandits who inhabit the area would    
build a place like this until you see the breathtaking view to the south.    
A clear shot of the track outside the forest can be seen from the cover     
of the leaves, creating an excellent scouting advantage over any wouldbe    
travelers.  A flimsy rope bridge connects to a tree directly east of you,    
otherwise the ladder leading down to the forest floor remains.

An old dirt track~
Scuttling beetles and sprigs of grass look to be the only creatures that    
actively use the dusty old track beneath your feet.  Shadows play across    
the ground thanks to the gentle breeze that tugs at your clothing.  You     
notice several ruts in the dirt, likely from the traffic of wagons that    
may have once passed through here.  Pines, spruce and oak trees speckle    
the landscape all around you, branches swaying under an unseen force.    
The track meanders south and north, the trees beginning to grow more    
thickly together.

Ebony backed beetles and others spotted of various colors scurry about their    
business from one edge of the track to the other.  They pay little to no heed    
to your presence.

The sparse blades of grass striving to live in the desert soil of the track    
are having marginal success.  The further away from the edges the patches of    
grass lie, the worse off they seem to be doing.
