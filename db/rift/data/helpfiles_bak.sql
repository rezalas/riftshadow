This means that we trust you with something that\r\nliterally tens of thousands of hours of work has gone into.  We expect you\r\nto do all of our work justice and follow the rules that we\'ve set forth to\r\nkeep this game fair and fun for all.\r\n\r\n1) Our biggest and most strictly enforced rule for all Immortals is: do not\r\n   aid or favor your mortals, or the mortals of anyone else you know in any\r\n   way shape or form.  This includes but is not limited to restoring,\r\n   loading equipment or mobs, empowering without roleplay (which is \r\n   impossible for you to do with yourself), giving experience and\r\n   transferring.  If you have any questions about this particular rule, you\r\n   are encouraged to ask, and not experiment or test the limits.  Violation\r\n   of this rule WILL get you denied.\r\n\r\n   Do not log on as your mortal while your Immortal is logged on.  There \r\n   will be VERY few exceptions to this rule.  Giving the impression to our \r\n   players that there is cheating going on is just as bad as actually \r\n   cheating.  Play on a different MUD if you have to.\r\n\r\n2) If you don\'t have a certain Wiz command, it\'s for a reason.  As you\r\n   probably already know, there are ways to manipulate OLC to load objects,\r\n   mobs and the like and even give easy experience to players.  Doing this\r\n   will get you denied, as it is a violation of the trust we\'ve given you.\r\n   If you need something loaded, or need to give a player experience, etc.,\r\n   for a reason you believe to be valid, ask a higher-level Immortal.  If\r\n   a higher-level Immortal is not around, you are expected to wait and not\r\n   take the matter into your own hands.  This includes forcing mobs to drop \r\n   things, killing or slaying them or the like.\r\n\r\n3) Do not hold OOC discussions with a player, especially in front of other\r\n   players, unless it\'s in the Realm of the Dead or Description Room... or\r\n   of course the Newbie Channel.\r\n\r\n4) Finally... one of the most unprofessional things is the appearance of \r\n   disorder. If we don\'t appear to be on the same page as an Immstaff, then \r\n  \r\n   we look badly as a result.  If people get three different answers from \r\n   three different Imms to the same question, or if one of us tells a \r\n   mortal \"Well, yeah, that\'s how it is, but I don\'t like it either.\" \r\n   that\'s not acceptable.  Please don\'t try to speak for Riftshadow or the \r\n   Immstaff as a whole without checking with other (preferably higher) Imms\r\n   first.  If you think a player is right and we (i.e. other Imms, or the \r\n   status quo) are wrong, thank them and tell them you\'ll look into it.  \r\n   Then tell the rest of us and we\'ll decide what to do.  Don\'t tell the \r\n   players that you agree with them and certainly don\'t promise something \r\n   will get changed if you don\'t know it will. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, ask a higher-level Imm, and use common sense.\r\nIf there\'s any question in your mind about something, just don\'t do it\r\nuntil you\'ve spoken with others.',

If you\'re constantly telling your group that there\'s 1k TNL \r\nand you\'re logging off to go watch wrestling (yes, we\'ll know), you \r\nprobably shouldn\'t bother.\r\n\r\n2) Time:  Being an immortal is a time consuming task.  While we understand \r\nthat people can be busy for short periods of time, an active immstaff is \r\nnecessary for the betterment of the MUD.  If you play once a week for \r\nfifteen minutes, the odds of you imming are very slim.  If you become an \r\nentry level imm, you will be expected to spend at least five hours a week \r\non the MUD.\r\n\r\n3) History:  Obviously, all RS Immortals are required to obey all rules, \r\nboth immortal and mortal.  As a consequence, any new immortals should have \r\nno history of cheating, permagrouping, or anything else sketchy.  We \r\nunderstand that people make mistakes and we\'re willing to give people a \r\nchance, but if the current character has had rules violations, you \r\nprobably shouldn\'t bother.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe encourage people to apply even if they\'re not sure they\'ll be accepted, \r\nproviding that they are ready to do the work required if they are \r\naccepted.  At the worst, you won\'t receive a response.',

It is for this reason that\r\nwe have established a set of rules for all who wish to take part in the \r\nfun; we want everyone to have a good time.\r\n\r\nOur most important rule: Always stay in character.\r\nThis may sound simple enough, but it embodies most of the other rules that\r\nwe have set forth.  Breaking these rules ruins the environment that both \r\nthe Immortal Staff and the Players work so hard to maintain.\r\n\r\n * Playerkilling is allowed and encouraged.  This does not mean, however,\r\nthat you may do it without an \"in character\" (IC) reason.  You must\r\nroleplay ALL interactions with other players (with very few exceptions), \r\ncombat included.  Out of character (OOC) interactions are not allowed \r\nwhile within the game.\r\n\r\n * Exploiting bugs is extremely out of character, and of course unfair.\r\nPlayers found doing this will be dealt with harshly.  Dropping link to \r\navoid death is against the rules, and players caught doing so would suffer \r\nconsequences much more severe than those that they would be attempting to \r\nescape.\r\n\r\n * Multicharring/multiplaying (having more than one character logged on at\r\na time) is not allowed.  On that note, using one character to defeat a mob,\r\ngather equipment or otherwise help another one of your characters, directly\r\nor indirectly, mechanically or politically, is not allowed or tolerated. \r\nGrouping with other people that you know OOC is fine, as long as your\r\ninteractions are fully roleplayed.  \"Permagrouping,\" as it is called, is\r\nagainst the rules as well as generally frowned upon.\r\n\r\nThe rules are not limited to these specific examples of wrongdoing, so we \r\nask you to please think before your actions, because if you think it\'s\r\nagainst the rules, there\'s a good chance that it is. Any questions can be\r\naddressed via e-mail to immortals@riftshadow.net, and we will respond as\r\nquickly as possible. We honestly don\'t want to punish anyone for breaking \r\nany of these rules. Having to do so is definitely not fun for us, the \r\ncheater/rulebreaker, or those whose gaming experience is effected by the \r\nactions of the cheater/rulebreaker.

		'Playerkilling is a major aspect of the game of Riftshadow.  It is\r\nencouraged through cabal wars, limited items of great power and\r\nroleplaying, and therefore is commonplace in this MUD.  At low levels, you\r\nwill be protected from other players, and they from you.  Upon reaching the\r\n11th level, this protection will no longer be granted to you, and you will \r\nbe able to kill other players, and they you.  A level 51 character won\'t be\r\nable to bully around level 11\'s, of course.  We have what is called a \"PK\r\nrange\" system to keep this from happening, which is based upon many factors\r\nto keep things fair, so that those who you can fight with are never more\r\nthan a few levels above or below you.\r\n\r\nPlayerkilling must be roleplayed.  Your character may die, but you should\r\nnot allow it to anger you in real life.  Far too often, people bring\r\nin-character conflicts into real life, and begin hurling threats and\r\ninsults at the player behind the character.  This is a rules violation and\r\nwill not be tolerated.  Killing the same person multiple times or killing \r\nwithout a roleplayed reason is also frowned upon, and should it become \r\nnecessary, the Immstaff will intervene.\r\n\r\nThe main trick to playerkilling in Riftshadow is to keep with it. Instead\r\nof losing hope when you are killed, learn from the mistakes that you have\r\nmade and become better.  In order to minimize the frustration of PK deaths\r\nfor the defeated without taking away reward for the victor, corpses may\r\nonly be looted one object at a time, and full-looting is discouraged. This\r\ngives the defeated player time to get back to his or her corpse, so that\r\nhe or she can retrieve a good deal of their lost equipment.\r\n\r\nAlso see: DEATH, RULES',

Mechanically, it will\r\naffect your character\'s ability to wear some kinds of equipment or \r\nvulnerability to certain kinds of spells or supplications.  Roleplay-wise,\r\nyou will be expected to act in a certain fashion.\r\n\r\nThe three basic alignments are GOOD, NEUTRAL and EVIL.\r\nThere are many, many different ways to play each of the above.  For\r\nexample, one could play a militant good character that zealously destroys\r\nevil in all forms.  There could be a good character that accepts the fact\r\nthat there are evil people in the world, but strives to live a full life\r\nfor himself and others.  There could an evil character that is deceptive\r\nand treacherous, trying to gain power for himself at the cost of others,\r\nor there could be an evil character that\'s just an outright bully.\r\n\r\nOf course, roles aren\'t usually this simple and are definitely not limited\r\nto these cookie-cutterish examples.  One important thing to remember is\r\nthat evil characters generally don\'t regard themselves as \'evil.\'  It\'s\r\nlikely that they just don\'t adhere to the moral code that\'s generally\r\naccepted, or any moral code at all.  By today\'s standards, for example,\r\nsomeone who would rule by the characteristics listed within \'The Prince\' by\r\nMachiavelli (such as killing people for the sole reason of making an \r\nexample out of them as to secure a political position) would be considered \r\nincredibly evil, but if you were to ask the person who did it would \r\nprobably not consider themselves evil.

		'     In the ancient days before the civilization of Shalar, mortals lived \r\nwithin the wilds and gained virtue and strength from it. When \r\nthe \"Others\" arrived upon the face of Shalar, their mere presence was a \r\nbane upon the land, and with the destruction of the Great War nearly all \r\nknowledge of the ways of old were lost. As the second age began, the \r\ninhabitants of Shalar no longer held such love for nature as they once \r\ndid.  Nearly all people and races began to rely upon cities and their \r\nwares. The city life caused them to grow soft, and many of nature\'s \r\nlessons have since been forgotten.\r\n  \r\n     It is said that Gawinn first appeared in the early days of the \r\nSecond Age.  Out of good will towards mortals, Gawinn sought to teach them \r\nto return to the natural, in hopes that they might learn from it, and in \r\nturn better themselves.  By his will he formed an order called \r\nthe \"Erethryn\", or \"Ironwood\" in the common tongue. The members of this \r\norder are said to be as strong and steadfast as their namesake.  \r\n    \r\n      The Erethryn seek to teach the inhabitants of Shalar to depend less \r\nupon the cities which only serve as a crutch. They wish all to learn \r\nonce again the all-providing power of nature. Only when one returns to the \r\nwilds will they be strong and steadfast like the ironwood, whos roots are \r\nplanted deeply, and drink deeply alike.\r\n\r\nSeek out the shrine of the Lord of the Erethryn within the deep woods, \r\nwithin sight of civilization.',

In \r\nfact they welcome it when it comes, because this life is merely a limbo \r\nbetween the creation of a spirit and its birth.\r\nThis world is a place for the spirit to grow stronger and richer in\r\npreparation for the next.

Proficiency points are awarded automatically for each hour \r\nplayed, representing skills acquired as your character grows older.\r\n\r\nFor every hour, you receive five points which then can be used towards \r\ntraining a proficiency.  To train in a proficiency, you must first \r\nfind a teacher.  Teachers can be found all over Shalar, with some basic \r\nones residing in the Common Guild\'s former home.  The proficiencies \r\ncommand alone lists what proficiencies you know, unless you are in the \r\nroom with a teacher.  In a room with a teacher, it will tell you what \r\nproficiencies that teacher offers that are available to \r\nyou.  \'Proficiencies basic\' (or \'prof basic\' for short) lists all of the \r\nbasic proficiencies.  More advanced ones will have to be sought out from \r\nwilling teachers all across Shalar.\r\n\r\nTo train a proficiency, type prof train <proficiency name> when in the \r\nroom with a teacher for that proficiency.  Teachers interested in \r\ninstructing adventurers will typically give a sign of some sort, such as \r\na nod or an invitation.\r\n\r\nBasic proficiencies are taught by teachers in the former Common Guild off \r\nWest Toller Road in Cimar.',
