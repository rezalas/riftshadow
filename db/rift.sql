This means that we trust you with something that\r\nliterally tens of thousands of hours of work has gone into.  We expect you\r\nto do all of our work justice and follow the rules that we\'ve set forth to\r\nkeep this game fair and fun for all.\r\n\r\n1) Our biggest and most strictly enforced rule for all Immortals is: do not\r\n   aid or favor your mortals, or the mortals of anyone else you know in any\r\n   way shape or form.  This includes but is not limited to restoring,\r\n   loading equipment or mobs, empowering without roleplay (which is \r\n   impossible for you to do with yourself), giving experience and\r\n   transferring.  If you have any questions about this particular rule, you\r\n   are encouraged to ask, and not experiment or test the limits.  Violation\r\n   of this rule WILL get you denied.\r\n\r\n   Do not log on as your mortal while your Immortal is logged on.  There \r\n   will be VERY few exceptions to this rule.  Giving the impression to our \r\n   players that there is cheating going on is just as bad as actually \r\n   cheating.  Play on a different MUD if you have to.\r\n\r\n2) If you don\'t have a certain Wiz command, it\'s for a reason.  As you\r\n   probably already know, there are ways to manipulate OLC to load objects,\r\n   mobs and the like and even give easy experience to players.  Doing this\r\n   will get you denied, as it is a violation of the trust we\'ve given you.\r\n   If you need something loaded, or need to give a player experience, etc.,\r\n   for a reason you believe to be valid, ask a higher-level Immortal.  If\r\n   a higher-level Immortal is not around, you are expected to wait and not\r\n   take the matter into your own hands.  This includes forcing mobs to drop \r\n   things, killing or slaying them or the like.\r\n\r\n3) Do not hold OOC discussions with a player, especially in front of other\r\n   players, unless it\'s in the Realm of the Dead or Description Room... or\r\n   of course the Newbie Channel.\r\n\r\n4) Finally... one of the most unprofessional things is the appearance of \r\n   disorder. If we don\'t appear to be on the same page as an Immstaff, then \r\n  \r\n   we look badly as a result.  If people get three different answers from \r\n   three different Imms to the same question, or if one of us tells a \r\n   mortal \"Well, yeah, that\'s how it is, but I don\'t like it either.\" \r\n   that\'s not acceptable.  Please don\'t try to speak for Riftshadow or the \r\n   Immstaff as a whole without checking with other (preferably higher) Imms\r\n   first.  If you think a player is right and we (i.e. other Imms, or the \r\n   status quo) are wrong, thank them and tell them you\'ll look into it.  \r\n   Then tell the rest of us and we\'ll decide what to do.  Don\'t tell the \r\n   players that you agree with them and certainly don\'t promise something \r\n   will get changed if you don\'t know it will. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, ask a higher-level Imm, and use common sense.\r\nIf there\'s any question in your mind about something, just don\'t do it\r\nuntil you\'ve spoken with others.',''),(181,'\'PASS WITHOUT TRACE\'','none',0,'Syntax: c \'pass without trace\'\r\n\r\nThis ooze para-elemental spell causes the earth to melt together to cover\r\nthe tracks of the caster.',''),(182,'\'EMULSIFY\'','none',0,'Syntax: c \'emulsify\' <target>\r\n\r\nThis ooze-based spell distends the target\'s midsection.

This includes but is not limited to restoring,\r\n   loading equipment or mobs, empowering without roleplay (which is \r\n   impossible for you to do with yourself), giving experience and\r\n   transferring.  If you have any questions about this particular rule, you\r\n   are encouraged to ask, and not experiment or test the limits.  Violation\r\n   of this rule WILL get you denied.\r\n\r\n   Do not log on as your mortal while your Immortal is logged on.  There \r\n   will be VERY few exceptions to this rule.  Giving the impression to our \r\n   players that there is cheating going on is just as bad as actually \r\n   cheating.

Doing this\r\n   will get you denied, as it is a violation of the trust we\'ve given you.\r\n   If you need something loaded, or need to give a player experience, etc.,\r\n   for a reason you believe to be valid, ask a higher-level Immortal.  If\r\n   a higher-level Immortal is not around, you are expected to wait and not\r\n   take the matter into your own hands.  This includes forcing mobs to drop \r\n   things, killing or slaying them or the like.\r\n\r\n3) Do not hold OOC discussions with a player, especially in front of other\r\n   players, unless it\'s in the Realm of the Dead or Description Room... or\r\n   of course the Newbie Channel.\r\n\r\n4) Finally... one of the most unprofessional things is the appearance of \r\n   disorder.

Breaking these rules ruins the environment that both \r\nthe Immortal Staff and the Players work so hard to maintain.\r\n\r\n * Playerkilling is allowed and encouraged.  This does not mean, however,\r\nthat you may do it without an \"in character\" (IC) reason.  You must\r\nroleplay ALL interactions with other players (with very few exceptions), \r\ncombat included.  Out of character (OOC) interactions are not allowed \r\nwhile within the game.\r\n\r\n * Exploiting bugs is extremely out of character, and of course unfair.\r\nPlayers found doing this will be dealt with harshly.  Dropping link to \r\navoid death is against the rules, and players caught doing so would suffer \r\nconsequences much more severe than those that they would be attempting to \r\nescape.\r\n\r\n * Multicharring/multiplaying (having more than one character logged on at\r\na time) is not allowed.  On that note, using one character to defeat a mob,\r\ngather equipment or otherwise help another one of your characters, directly\r\nor indirectly, mechanically or politically, is not allowed or tolerated. \r\nGrouping with other people that you know OOC is fine, as long as your\r\ninteractions are fully roleplayed.  \"Permagrouping,\" as it is called, is\r\nagainst the rules as well as generally frowned upon.\r\n\r\nThe rules are not limited to these specific examples of wrongdoing, so we \r\nask you to please think before your actions, because if you think it\'s\r\nagainst the rules, there\'s a good chance that it is. Any questions can be\r\naddressed via e-mail to immortals@riftshadow.net, and we will respond as\r\nquickly as possible. We honestly don\'t want to punish anyone for breaking \r\nany of these rules.
